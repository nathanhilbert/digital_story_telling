Nowhere is this more evident than in the agriculture sector and the state of food insecurity in many countries and especially among the most vulnerable and marginalized groups. For a variety of seemingly intractable reasons African agriculture has not yet effectively made the transition from small, semi-subsistence farming that is poorly linked to the burgeoning urban markets, to commercially-oriented farming that enable farmers to draw a living income by understanding and responding to the growing demand of Africa&rsquo;s fast growing cities.</p>

<p>The African Union Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Program (CAADP) seeks to propel this needed transformation of African agriculture from the low input, low output situation that is common to semi-subsistence farming to one based on reliable markets.&nbsp; With such markets it is worth a farmer&rsquo;s while to invest in his or her farmland and to purchase inputs and productivity enhancing equipment, and to produce primarily for the market (eg. Farming as a Business). The US Government&rsquo;s Feed the Future (FTF) program supports the transformation initiative of AU&rsquo;s CAADP.</p>

<p>Africa Lead is implemented by a consortium of development organizations &ndash; DAI, ECI-Africa, Management Systems International (MSI), Michigan State University (MSU), Training Resources Group, Inc., (TRG) and Winrock International under contract number: EDH-I-00-05-00004/TO&rdquo;AID-OAA-TO-10-00045. Africa Lead began as a 24-month project, extended to 39-months, was implemented through first three and then two regional offices &ndash; Nairobi, Kenya and Accra, Ghana (the South Africa office closed in July 2012) &ndash; and an HQ office in the Washington, DC area and had a final budget of over 25 million USD.&nbsp; This report is funded by the U.S. agency for International Development.&nbsp; The authors&rsquo; views expressed in this publication do not necessarily reflect the views of the USAID or the U.S. Government.</p>

<p>As a crucial initial part of the FTF support to CAADP, USAID designed the innovative African Leadership Training and Capacity Building Program (Africa Lead) to spearhead a variety of activities key amongst which is to get the word out to a broader audience of agriculture and food security stakeholders about CAADP goals, principles and processes. Another key initial focus of Africa Lead is to address head on the issue of strengthening the leadership in institutions and organizations that have to be highly effective if the desired transformation in agriculture and food security is to be achieved.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This report is structured in a dynamic format that mirrors the energy demonstrated by those who have participated in Africa Lead activities. &nbsp;This Context section presents an overall summary of the Africa Lead program, its goals, objectives and operational structure. This is followed by the Activities section that describes each of the four tasks and its main activities, along with the overall results and outcomes of the tasks. The report continues in the Outcomes section with a discussion of the programmatic and operational lessons learned from program implementation. Together these sections along with a final Appendices section tell the full story of the diversity of Africa Lead through the three years of the program. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

These range from high-level support at the level of the African Union to assistance to national and sub-national farmer based organizations and training of Food Security Champions.</p>

<p>Africa Lead provides leadership and change management training (Champions for Change) and training in program and project design, project technical and financial management, and monitoring and evaluation (Task 1). The program also provides logistical and financial support for third party technical and process management training as well as some deeper design and planning support for workshops and conferences &ndash; some very high level, some more down-to-earth -- designed to improve knowledge on a range of topics key to improving Africa&rsquo;s agricultural productivity (Task 2). Driving much of the Task 2 work, Africa Lead also designs and conducts capacity needs assessments of institutions and processes critical to improved agriculture programming at regional, national and sub-national levels, looking at the CAADP process, individual institutions, and agriculture and food security policy processes (Task 3). Finally, in terms of services provided, Africa Lead designs and populates a database of institutions in Africa and around the world and their short courses that are relevant to transforming African agriculture. This database has been turned over to OER-Africa to, in collaboration with RUFORUM, maintain for the last year of the project.</p>

The purpose of this report is to describe the USAID&rsquo;s Africa Lead program and summarize the four tasks that were implemented over the three year time period of this program (September 2010 &ndash; November 2013). This report is also written to both present the results and outcomes of the program as well as capture the main lessons that have been learned during the design, customization and implementation of all of the Africa Lead&rsquo;s tasks.</p>

<p>Africa Lead is a capacity building program that operates across three Sub-Saharan Africa&nbsp;regions working across public, civil society, university and private sector institutions. The program seeks to establish and maintain a critical mass of food security &ldquo;Champions&rdquo; who can drive agriculture-led development by leading and implementing the Regional and National Agriculture Investment Plans within the CAADP framework. In addition, Africa Lead has conducted institutional capacity assessments, sponsored agriculture interns and created a database of food security and agriculture related online trainings, while functioning as a support mechanism for the USAID Missions by providing logistical support for conferences, trainings and meetings.&nbsp;</p>




                    <h2 id="intro">Background and History of Project</h2>
<p>Africa Lead is a region-wide program sponsored by the U.S. government&rsquo;s Agency for International Development (USAID) designed to support the capacity building program of the U.S. Government&rsquo;s <em>Feed the Future </em>(FTF) Initiative, which aligns U.S. Government development assistance with Africa-owned agriculture development plans that are, in turn, aligned with the African Union&rsquo;s <em>Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Program</em> (CAADP). These CAADP plans and initiatives seek to contribute to the <em>Millennium Development Goals</em> (MDG) by both encouraging and ensuring that governments throughout the continent apply 10% of their public budgets to agriculture in an effort to achieve the 6% annual growth in agricultural productivity that is needed to achieve sustainable food security throughout the continent.</p>

                <p>Africa Lead supported human and institutional capacity development and was initially a two-year task order under the RAISE Plus Indefinite Quantity Contract (IQC) mechanism, designed to run from September 20, 2010 to September 30, 2012, with a budget ceiling of $21,332,381. However, on September 30, 2012 the contract was modified to extend the program for one more year (through September 2013) and raise the ceiling by $4,850,000 to $26,182,381. In addition, Africa Lead received a 3 month no cost extension in September 2013, putting the final end of contract as November 30, 2013.</p>

<p>Over the three years, Africa Lead provided support to the Missions through leadership and customized training, capacity assessments, logistical support for training and internships and a database of training offerings on the continent that can be matched to the leadership training and capacity building needs. The program has been &nbsp;implemented by lead RAISE Plus IQC holder, DAI, supported by Management Systems International (MSI), Winrock International, Training Resources Group (TRG), ECI <em>Africa</em> Consulting (Pty) Ltd., and Michigan State University (MSU). Each partner plays a specific role in the implementation of Africa Lead and working collaboratively to implement the complex project, always adapting together to provide a flexible mechanism that could meet the needs of the Missions (see table)</p>

                    <h2 id="intro">Goals and Purpose of Africa Lead </h2>


<p>Economic growth in Africa has begun to accelerate, but poverty remains extensive and food security continues to be a challenge on the continent. This is because agricultural productivity, the foundation of food and financial security has been lagging. The African Union&rsquo;s CAADP is designed to confront that reality and lay the groundwork for &ldquo;transformative&rdquo; change in agriculture. The objective of the Africa Lead program is to support this transformation by strengthening a cadre of African professionals able to design, implement and measure the impact of food security policies and programs that will strongly affect productivity and food security. Africa Lead represents an early and important part of the US Government&rsquo;s FTF capacity building approach which aligns U.S. Government development assistance with Africa-owned agriculture development plans that are, in turn, aligned with the African Union&rsquo;s CAADP.</p>

<p>Ultimately, in order to achieve the ambitious goals of CAADP and FTF, the Africa Lead program is designed to enhance scalability and sustainability in the development of evidence-grounded agriculture and food security policies and programs. This is achieved by expanding the number of experienced professionals in African organizations &ndash; government, non-government and private &ndash; with the mindsets, skills and technical expertise to assume leadership roles in moving the CAADP agenda forward. The Africa Lead mechanism provides support specifically to the FTF initiative for the USAID Southern, East and West Africa Regional Missions and to local Missions in all 12 African FTF focus and FTF-aligned countries through a variety of capacity building activities. The FTF initiative calls not simply for host-country partnership but country leadership. So by working across public and private institutions, Africa Lead works to build the capacity of Africa&rsquo;s emerging food security leaders to devise and manage their country investment plans through activities such as, but not limited to, developing and delivering leadership and innovative trainings, conducting institutional capacity assessments, supporting business-to-business exchanges (internships for agricultural professionals) and student internships, providing logistical support for trainings and conferences, and creating a database of African leadership and capacity building trainings.</p>


                    <p>Africa Lead&rsquo;s goals focus on the achievable objectives of contributing to the increase of the institutional and individual capacity for food security programming. In addition, throughout the three years Africa Lead also implemented activities that contribute indirectly to the overall goals of FTF and CAADP : <em>Reducing poverty and hunger in focus countries</em> (G1) and <em>Increasing agricultural productivity </em>(G1.1) as is illustrated in the projects Results Framework (See Africa Lead&rsquo;s Results Framework).</p>

<p>The results framework lays out the project&rsquo;s strategy to both achieve the objectives of the project and contribute to the higher level goals of FTF and CAADP. Although these two higher level goals are out of the manageable control of the Africa Lead project, Africa Lead has been able to provide needed support to FTF and CAADP&rsquo;s lower level goals of <em>Implementing, funding and approving country investment plans (</em>G1.2) and <em>Improving the performance of key institutions in implementing their CAADP agenda </em>(G1.3). Africa Lead&rsquo;s Strategic objectives of 1) <em>Increasing the participation of African leaders and institutions engaged in the CAADP process </em>(SO1) and 2) S<em>trengthening key leaders technical and managerial skills and knowledge of agriculture systems and food security</em> (SO2) directly support G1.2 and G1.3, which in turn support the overall goals G1 and G1.1. Africa lead&rsquo;s strategic objectives are also supported by the lower level intermediate results which are illustrated in the casual chain in the results framework.</p>

<p>Primary responsibility for program activity implementation in the field lies with the regional offices located in Africa, each managed by a Deputy Chief of Party (DCoP), who functions as the Regional Program Director. LINK to APPENDICES: ORG CHART Originally there were three offices: The West Africa regional office in Accra, Ghana, The Southern Africa regional office in Pretoria, South Africa and the East Africa regional office, based in Nairobi, Kenya. However, in July 2012, the third office in South Africa was closed and all the project Southern Africa activities were implemented out of the Nairobi, Kenya office, which became the East and Southern Africa (ESA) office.</p>

<p id="database_start" class="subreportpoint database_start">Africa Lead was initially set up with funds from USAID/Africa in Washington, as well as the East Africa, West Africa and Southern Africa Missions. However the project is designed so that all USAID bureaus, the three regional Missions and the 13 bilateral Missions participating in FTF could easily &ldquo;buy-in&rdquo; for specific services from Africa Lead, which most did. Although this has provided some challenges and complexity and requires a great deal of flexibility within each of the Africa Lead offices, it has allowed the project to meet the specific needs of the Missions and work collaboratively with them to adjust the activities to achieve desired results. This flexibility and responsiveness shown throughout the implementation of Africa Lead has became one of the main qualities in the program&rsquo;s success.</p>

<p>To address the main capacity building needs identified by USAID in designing Africa Lead, the program is organized along four main tasks or service areas, each focusing on different key components of the project designed to support each of its strategic objectives. Each Task area is led by a Task leader who is then overseen by the COP. Africa Lead&rsquo;s four task areas are:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Task 1:</strong> Transformational Leadership Training and CAADP Sensitization</li>
    <li><strong>Task 2:</strong> Technical and Third Party Training, Conferences and Other Innovative Learning Experiences</li>
    <li><strong>Task 3:</strong> Institutional Capacity Needs Assessments</li>
    <li><strong>Task 4:</strong> Database of Technical and Managerial Short Courses on Offer from Universities and Training Institutions</li>
</ul>

<p class="subreportpoint database_end">>Each of these tasks has several subtasks, programs and activities. For example, Task One includes the design and delivery of leadership and change management training modules, Module One (Champions for Change) and Module Two (Project Design and Rapid Results Approach). &nbsp;Task Two encompasses all of the customized training and innovative learning approaches, such as, the Business to Business exchanges (B2B)&nbsp;as well as logistical support for workshops and for participants to attend specialized third-party training courses. Task Three includes all of the institutional and process capacity assessments and Task Four is the development and transfer of the training database. &nbsp;Each of these task areas plays its role in supporting Africa Lead&rsquo;s overall objectives and each of these tasks are described in detail in following section on Activities along with the results and outcomes for each.</p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>This project seeks to enhance and grow a database of short courses and Open Educational Resources (OER) offered by different institutions, which can be used to facilitate the ongoing development of agricultural professionals, students and other stakeholders working in the agricultural sector. The database of short courses of the &nbsp;Africa Lead Project was initially designed and implemented by Michigan State University.&nbsp; It was taken over by OER Africa which is at present hosting the database on a stand-alone server, for an African-wide programme. OER Africa, together with RUFORUM is responsible for overseeing the updating of the database on a regular basis.</p>

<p>The database is being publicized widely not only to graduates of the Africa Lead Champions for Change courses but to many other high ranking personnel in government positions, faculty, non-governmental organizations and other interested persons. The Champions for Change programme seeks to build the capacity of agriculture leaders to prioritize activities and implement Regional and Country Agriculture Investment Plans within the CAADP framework. The database serves as a valuable resource that will ensure that some of the courses offered by Africa&rsquo;s finest agricultural institutions and many in America, Europe and worldwide will be rendered highly visible, to ensure their widespread dissemination and usage.</p>

<p>Beginning December 2012, OER Africa in conjunction with RUFORUM, the Regional Universities Forum for Capacity Building in Agriculture, trained staff and students at 19 universities across Eastern and Southern Africa (in Ethiopia, Kenya, Lesotho, Uganda, Tanzania, Malawi, Zambia, Zimbabwe and Swaziland) in the use of the Africa Lead Database. &nbsp;INSERT OER&rsquo;S &ldquo;tuorial&rdquo; interactive HTML file.&nbsp; This phase of the project aimed to introduce institutions to the database and to teach individuals there how to upload information about their course offerings and therefore increase their dissemination. A total of 25 institutions (in Kenya, Malawi, Tanzania, Uganda, Ethiopia, Lesotho, Swaziland, Mozambique , Rwanda and South Africa) were invited to participate. Only the South African institutions targeted by the project were not members of RUFORUM.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The training component of the project was implemented over 3 months (December 2013 to February 2013) with very tight timeframes that resulted in a series of challenges that speak to some of the overall lessons learnt. These are discussed later on in this brief report. However, despite the challenges faced this aspect of the project was successfully completed and the database base continues to grow steadily. With regards to implementation at the institutions, challenges mostly had to do with access to the internet and the use of old and incompatible software and hardware, but in general the project was well received. The targeting of the right institutional staff members was found to be critical in ensuring buy-in and participation.</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><img src="img/Lessons_graph1.png" style="height:510px" /></p>

<p>It can be seen that over 3500 people have visited the database during the period 1 December 2012 to 30 September 2013 with 80.67% of the visits being first time ones and a return rate of 19.2%. The average visit duration was 3 minutes and 23 seconds. There is a bounce-rate of 60.88% which is rather high and needs further interrogation. The accessing of the database has been more or less consistent as shown by the graph above, however the number of courses newly uploaded at different times varied considerably with 444 being uploaded during the period December 2012 to February 2013, and then 93 and 131 new uploads over the next two time periods (March to June and then July to September 2013).&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The initial big difference in the new course uploads is probably due to the fact that the project team was actively involved in ensuring project milestones were achieved during the first time period. It was also the beginning of the academic year at many institutions and so they had their course offerings ready. Most visits to the site were from South Africa which may be linked to the fact that the top course providers are also from South Africa and Namibia.</p>

<p>Of the top 20 providers eight are higher education institutions whilst the rest consist of other training organizations involved in development. The top 20 course providers can be seen from the database screen grab in table 1 below. The majority of these providers serve institutions and individuals situated on the African continent however there were some from other countries such as the United States of America, United Kingdom and Malaysia. The number of course providers has increased steadily from 151 to 192 over the ten month period from December 2012 to September 2013.</p>

<h3>Lessons learnt</h3>

<p>Despite the challenges faced much was achieved within very tight and inflexible time-frames. However there are a few lessons learnt from the project that should be taken into consideration for the planning and implementation of future projects of this nature:</p>

<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not all African higher education institution staff had regular access to internet or laptops or up-to-date software and so alternative ways had to be used in training them to learn about and use the database. In this regard, a simulation (online and offline) was developed and used to show people how to use the database by projecting pictures via a data projector. CDs and a training pamphlet were disseminated to all participants to support them in accessing and using the database after the initial training.</p>

<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A template to collect course information was also developed that could be filled in easily on one&rsquo;s computer using a word processing package or could printed out for a person to complete manually, scan and submit. This sort of tool proved to very useful when training at sites where connectivity and access to suitable hardware and software was limited.</p>

<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is important to <em>target the right people for the training</em> especially those tasked by their institutions to make their courses/programmes visible &ndash; in this way one contributes to ensuring the continuity, sustainability and growth of the database. At some institutions trainers felt that some of the beneficiaries sent for the training were not the right ones meaning that in the long run the institution would not benefit from the capacity being developed.</p>

<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There were some challenges experienced in <em>identifying and getting permission for the right people to be trained</em> &ndash; in some instances the associated bureaucratic red-tape and hierarchical institutional protocol created bottlenecks, barriers and delays. These issues need to be taken into consideration up-front and also link directly to lesson 3 listed above</p>

<ol>
    <li>Institutions have times of the year when it is <em>difficult to involve staff (especially academic staff) in training because of heavy work commitments</em> as well as the inclusion of extended holidays &ndash; project implementation happened during such a period and academic staff (whilst interested) were not as keen to take the time off to engage properly with the training and advocacy interventions. This needs to be taken into consideration when looking at future project implementation -- be it training, or general on-site advocacy.</li>
    <li>Some <em>institutions were neither easily contactable nor accessible due to their geographical location</em>. Some thought has to be put into how best to reach and inform such institutions and get them to use and contribute to growing the database.</li>
    <li>There is a <em>need for more flexibility or else lengthened project timeframes</em> to accommodate the inflexibility of the USAID travel regulations and the slow response times to travel permission requests &ndash; much as it is understood why they are necessary, one cannot then generally expect good project outcomes when working with higher education institutions that have their own particular time related challenges (as outlined in lessons 4 and 5 above; we were lucky that the partners had project members based in 3 different countries that somehow mitigated this challenge and introduced a slight element of flexibility.</li>
    <li>Working with <em>RUFORUM as a partner was extremely beneficial and facilitated easier identification of and access to the participating institutions</em> and thus a better response was obtained from the RUFORUM member institutions as opposed to those that are not. Discussions held with the RUFORUM staff member that participated in institutional visits and training gave the following answers in response to the questions on the perceived <em>usefulness and sustainability of the database</em>:</li>
</ol>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Question: In your opinion is the database useful?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Response:</strong><em> &nbsp;&nbsp; Yes. It is useful to RUFORUM and the network as a whole. It closely links to our Theory of Change by addressing one of our deliverables &ldquo;Dynamic Platform for University Networking, Advocacy for Agricultural Higher Education&rdquo;</em></p>

<p><strong>Question: What is the relevance of promoting professional development through short courses among your member universities? </strong></p>

<p><strong>Response:</strong><em> &nbsp;&nbsp; The approach gives publicity to the ongoing short professional courses offered. The universities I visited had ongoing short courses that would be relevant for sharing within the network but had no central place to host or advertise the courses, nor was there someone to push this content/information online. </em></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Secondly, RUFORUM is keen to see its member universities academic rankings increase. This can be partly achieved through the visibility of their course offerings online which then contributes to the improved the visibility of the network universities. </em></p>

<p><em>Thirdly, the RUFORUM secretariat holds short skills enhancement courses or retreats for its postgraduate students. The Africa Lead Database could be used to enhance how RUFORUM delivers these courses. RUFORUM would then focus on packaging them so they are accessible and visible online. &nbsp;</em></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Question: <em>Where do you think the database should best be positioned or situated? </em></strong></p>

<p><strong>Response: &nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><em>I think given that the database serves to promote the universities content/course offerings and improve service delivery it would be best hosted by RUFORUM. We at RUFORUM see ourselves as having a platform that fosters collaboration between its member institutions. This also speaks well to our need to fulfill the dissemination aspect to the network of institutions.</em></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Question: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How will what you have learned whilst implementing the project guide your work aimed at sustaining the database?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Response:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><em>Clearly, the database needs to be hosted and someone dedicated to improving its content on an ongoing basis to make sure the information about courses offered within the network is available online. This will require time and resources. Some course offerings only become available through physical visits to institutions and getting to understand whom to work with to get the relevant information online.</em></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Question:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How did the grant provide catalytic help?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Response:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><em> It enabled capacity building through enabling the online training sessions and the physical visits. The skills attained were helpful and I am sure the website statistics also speak to this.</em></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>OER Africa team members are in agreement with these sentiments. The following section looks at some recommendations regarding the ways in which the database might be made sustainable.</p>

<h3>Sustainability of the database &ndash; some recommendations</h3>

<p>There is a need to find a sustainable way of growing the database further (in a resource friendly way) through new course uploads and increasing the number of visits to it. This requires a multi-pronged approach.</p>

<ol>
    <li>Encouraging continued institutional course uploads by:</li>
</ol>

<ul>
    <li>sending regular reminders to individuals who underwent training and where possible</li>
    <li>strategically targeting other individuals such as librarians, university marketing and short learning programme staff by email and phone to help get the message out there and collect the information required.</li>
</ul>

<p>This approach is likely to be more effective than trying to get academic staff members who are often extremely busy, to upload information on a regular basis.</p>

<ol>
    <li>Identifying and then directly marketing the database to short course service providers inviting them to either upload course information or provide hyperlinks to the relevant information. &nbsp;</li>
    <li>Advertising information about the database:
    <ul>
        <li>In the quarterly <em>Saide</em> online newsletter.</li>
        <li>other suitable online spaces such as OER Africa&rsquo;s AgShare and the RUFORUM websites as well as on</li>
        <li>institutional intranets (where possible).</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>&nbsp;Strategically piggy-backing some of the future Africa Lead training and advocacy at institutions to other project visits by the partners - to leverage existing resource synergies. Such an approach could contribute to more resource friendly continuous dissemination and advocacy about the database.</li>
    <li>Employing someone to spend a bit of time each month to:</li>
</ol>

<ul>
    <li><em>Search for and upload new courses</em> of existing service providers on the database</li>
    <li><em>Finding new service providers</em> (institutions and others) over and above the targeted ones &ndash; getting permission to upload their courses.&nbsp; A suitable template for capturing course information has been designed for this purpose. It can be sent out to the identified service providers who are then invited to provide course details that are then uploaded.</li>
    <li><em>maintain the functionality of the database and its server</em></li>
    <li>regularly <em>keep track of course uploads and database hits</em></li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This could possibly require additional financial resources however these costs could be paid for through cross-subsidization from related projects or aligning and embedding the database in either the OER Africa or RUFORUM spaces. However in order for this to be done in a sustainable way:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
    <li>The database could be converted to a more suitable platform that would make for easier administration and management. For example: right now it is a stand-alone database - on the Wordpress platform, and has limited tools. This platform differs from that of both OER Africa (Drupal) and the RUFORUM repository (AgriDrupal) &ndash; these platforms have tools that would improve the usability and visibility of the database.</li>
    <li>&nbsp;If the database were moved to the RUFORUM or OER Africa web-spaces it would mean all the available Agriculture open education resources and the short course information could be and accessed in one place.&nbsp;This would probably contribute to:<em> increased website functionality</em>, and <em>overall improved sustainability</em> as these two web spaces are visited regularly by various individuals. Linking it directly to the RUFORUM platform would be particularly strategic as RUFORUMs target beneficiaries are the same ones we would wish to use the database.</li>
    <li>It has been estimated that such a conversion would take about 15 days.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This would also be a cost-effective approach as the tools required are already in the system and would improve database functionality. This would mean the database is no longer a stand-alone, which is a challenge at present because it means maintaining a separate platform that needs an extra set of resources.</li>
    <li>At present there is also a high bounce rate and the database is not found that easily &ndash; this is attributed to the way the landing page is designed. There is a need to <em>improve the look and feel of the landing page</em> to mitigate the bounce rate.</li>
</ul>

<ol>
    <li><em>Follow up contact and the provision of online and telephonic support of the staff at institutions</em> where training has taken place to encourage them to keep up with ongoing course uploads (as the courses become available) or to submit the information so that they can be uploaded for them</li>
    <li>A <em>workshop training template</em> can be developed to support on-site training. This together with the <em>training simulation</em> designed to support staff involved in carrying out the database training can be circulated to those newly trained or introduced to the database, so that they can <em>continue training and provide support</em> at their institutions. These tools might need some revision if the database is shifted onto another platform.</li>
</ol>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>The database is useful and can definitely contribute to ongoing professional development and capacity building. However, in order to encourage its continued growth there is a need to mitigate those factors that have been identified as impacting negatively on the database and its use. The lessons learnt and the recommendations made in this report can be used to further improve the database and contribute to its sustainability in the longer term.</p>
