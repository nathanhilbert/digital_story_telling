                                          with substantial unfulfilled promise. Nowhere is this more evident than in the agriculture sector and the 
                                          state of food insecurity in many countries -- especially among the most vulnerable and marginalized groups.
                                          For a variety of seemingly intractable reasons African agriculture has not yet effectively made the transition
                                          from small, semi-subsistence farming that is poorly linked to the burgeoning urban markets. 
                                          Transitioning to commercially-oriented farming enables farmers to draw a living income by understanding and 
                                          responding to the growing demand of Africa&rsquo;s fast growing cities.</p>
                                          <p>The African Union Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Program (CAADP) seeks to propel this needed transformation of African agriculture from the low input, low output situation that is common to semi-subsistence farming to one based on reliable markets.&nbsp; With expanding markets it is increasingly worth a farmer&rsquo;s while to invest in his or her farmland and to purchase inputs and productivity-enhancing equipment shifting to production primarily for the market (eg. farming as a business).</p>

                                          Africa Lead is implemented by a consortium of development organizations &ndash; DAI, ECI-<em>Africa</em>, Management Systems International (MSI), Michigan State University (MSU), Training Resources Group, Inc., (TRG) and Winrock International under contract number: EDH-I-00-05-00004/TO&rdquo;AID-OAA-TO-10-00045. 
                                          Africa Lead began as a 24-month project, extended to 39-months, was implemented through first three and then two regional offices &ndash; Nairobi, Kenya and Accra, Ghana (the South Africa office closed in July 2012) &ndash; and an HQ office in the Washington, DC area and had a final budget of over 25 million USD.&nbsp; This report is funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development.&nbsp; The authors&rsquo;

                                          <p>The U.S. Government&rsquo;s Feed the Future (FTF) program supports the transformation initiative of AU&rsquo;s CAADP. As a crucial initial part of the FTF support to the African governments&rsquo; CAADP, USAID designed the innovative African Leadership Training and Capacity Building Program (Africa Lead) to spearhead a variety of activities. Key amongst these is to get the word out to a broader audience of agriculture and food security stakeholders about CAADP goals, principles and processes. Another key initial focus of Africa Lead is to address head-on the issue of strengthening the leadership in institutions and organizations that have to be highly effective if the desired transformation in agriculture and food security is to be achieved.</p>
                                          <p>This report is structured in a dynamic format that evokes the energy demonstrated by those who have participated in Africa Lead activities.&nbsp; This <strong>Context</strong> section presents an overall summary of the Africa Lead program, its goals, objectives and operational structure.</p>
                                          <p>This is followed by the <strong>Activities</strong> section that describes each of the four tasks and its main activities, along with the overall results and outcomes of the tasks.</p>
                                          <p>The report continues in the <strong>Lessons</strong> section with a discussion of the programmatic and operational lessons learned from program implementation.</p>
                                          <p>Together these sections, along with a final <strong>Appendices</strong> section, tell the full story of the diversity of Africa Lead through the first three years of the program.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

                                       <li> <a href="#" class="activities_grid"  data-largesrc="img/activitiesIMG.png" data-title="Activities" data-description="<p>Africa Lead provides a mutually reinforcing set of services to USAID&rsquo;s Bureau for Food Security, the Africa Bureau and to regional and bilateral USAID missions to help them achieve their FTF goals and support agricultural transformation across the continent. These services range from high-level support for the African Union to assistance to national and sub-national farmer based organizations and training of food security actors.</p>
                                          <p>Africa Lead provides leadership and change management training (&ldquo;Champions for Change&rdquo;) and training in program and project design, project technical and financial management, and monitoring and evaluation (Task 1).</p>
                                          <p>The program also provides logistical and financial support for third party technical and process management trainings, as well as some deeper design and planning support for workshops and conferences &ndash; from very high ministry level to grassroots civil society level -- designed to improve knowledge on a range of topics key to improving Africa&rsquo;s agricultural productivity (Task 2).</p>
                                          <p>Driving much of the Task 2 work, Africa Lead also designs and conducts capacity needs assessments of institutions at regional, national and sub-national levels, looking at the critical processes needed to improve agriculture programming. The scope of these assessments includes examining the CAADP process, individual institutions, and agriculture and food security policy processes within different countries (Task 3).</p>
                                          <p>Finally, in terms of services provided, Africa Lead has designed and populated a database of short courses from institutions in Africa and around the world that are relevant to transforming African agriculture (Task 4). This database has been turned over to OER-Africa to, in collaboration with RUFORUM, continue to maintain and develop the database even after the program ends.</p>

                                       <li> <a href="#" class="outcomes_grid"  data-largesrc="img/lessonsIMG.png" data-title="Lessons" data-description="<p>Africa Lead was conceived from the outset as capacity building for a very specific purpose.&nbsp; African governments have made a commitment to transform the agricultural potential of their countries in adopting the CAADP framework.&nbsp; The objective to proactively pursue food security strategies through training and hands-on engagement that leverages <strong>leadership</strong> skills is what sets Africa Lead apart.&nbsp; By devising and contextualizing curriculum and learning techniques, and selecting a cross-section of professionals, the training and networking activities have empowered a cadre of &ldquo;Champions for Change&rdquo; to make CAADP more actionable.&nbsp; It is these actors themselves who have created the concept of &ldquo;champion&rdquo;, a reflection of how personally and profoundly transformative they report the experience to be.</p>
                                          <p>Africa Lead has compiled feedback systematically both on short term reviews of the learning experience and longer term behavior change throughout the three years of the project.&nbsp; Data collection methods include pre and post training surveys, in-depth personal interviews, interim stocktaking and final lessons learned workshops.&nbsp; From these data a number of key lessons have been derived that signal how to sustain and advance the progress of Africa Lead and improve efficiencies.</p>
                                          <p>Among the most compelling findings are that leadership training is effective in energizing agents for change who embrace the power in non-hierarchal, consultative approaches. &nbsp;The fact that the training relies heavily on experiential learning techniques that are contextualized to African concepts and symbols is another powerful lesson as is leadership directly linked to agricultural productivity.&nbsp; The Champions themselves are the legacy of Africa Lead; they have the skills and the passion to carry on.&nbsp; Facilitating them to pass on their learning in a cascading effect ensures sustainability to this force for change.</p>
                                          <p>Other key lessons are derived from the institutional and policy coordination assessments undertaken by Africa Lead.&nbsp; There needs to be a continual engagement of key actors representing these units from the very outset of CAADP implementation.&nbsp; This includes outreach to all stakeholders to achieve inclusive and effective actions.&nbsp; Actions recommended must also be achievable.&nbsp; Setting targets that are within reach help advance the agenda and win the support of others.&nbsp; To further sustain such incremental progress the assessments suggest customized capacity building programs are worth donor investment.</p>
                                          <p>Thinking outside the box is producing action that is transforming the way change itself is understood, accepted and even embraced in terms of making communities, countries and the region more food secure.</p>

                           <h3>Background and History of Project</h3>
                           <p>Africa Lead is a region-wide program sponsored by the U.S. government&rsquo;s Agency for International Development (USAID) designed to support the capacity building program of the U.S. Government&rsquo;s <em>Feed the Future </em>(FTF) Initiative, which aligns U.S. Government development assistance with Africa-owned agriculture development plans that are, in turn, aligned with the African Union&rsquo;s Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Program (CAADP). These CAADP plans and initiatives seek to contribute to the <em>Millennium Development Goals</em> (MDG) by both encouraging and ensuring that governments throughout the continent apply 10% of their public budgets to agriculture in an effort to achieve the 6% annual growth in agricultural productivity that is needed to achieve sustainable food security throughout the continent.</p>
                           <p>Africa Lead-supported human and institutional capacity development was initially a two-year task order under the RAISE Plus Indefinite Quantity Contract (IQC) mechanism, designed to run from September 20, 2010 to September 30, 2012, with a budget ceiling of $21,332,381. However, on September 30, 2012 the contract was modified to extend the program for one more year (through September 2013) and raise the ceiling by $4,850,000 to $26,182,381. In addition, Africa Lead received a 3-month no cost extension in September 2013, putting the final end of contract as November 30, 2013.&nbsp;</p>

                           <p>Economic growth in Africa has begun to accelerate, but poverty remains extensive and food security continues to be a challenge on the continent. This is because agricultural productivity, the foundation of food and financial security has been lagging. The African Union&rsquo;s CAADP is designed to confront this reality and lay the groundwork for &ldquo;transformative&rdquo; change in agriculture.</p>
                           <p>The objective of the Africa Lead program is to support this transformation by strengthening a cadre of African professionals able to design, implement and measure the impact of food security policies and programs that will strongly affect productivity and food security. Africa Lead represents an early and important part of the U.S. Government&rsquo;s FTF capacity building approach which aligns U.S. Government development assistance with Africa-owned agriculture development plans that are, in turn, aligned with the African Union&rsquo;s CAADP.</p>
                           <p>Ultimately, in order to achieve the ambitious goals of CAADP and FTF, the Africa Lead program is designed to enhance scalability and sustainability in the development of evidence-grounded agriculture and food security policies and programs. This is achieved by expanding the number of experienced professionals in African organizations &ndash; government, non-government and private &ndash; with the mindsets, skills and technical expertise to assume leadership roles in moving the CAADP agenda forward.</p>
                           <p>The Africa Lead mechanism provides support specifically to the FTF initiative for the USAID Southern, East and West Africa Regional Missions and to local Missions in all 12 African FTF focus and FTF-aligned countries through a variety of capacity building activities.</p>
                           <p>The FTF initiative calls not simply for host-country partnership but country leadership. So by working across public and private institutions, Africa Lead works to build the capacity of Africa&rsquo;s emerging food security leaders to devise and manage their country investment plans through activities such as, but not limited to, developing and delivering leadership and innovative trainings, conducting institutional capacity assessments, supporting business-to-business exchanges (professional internships for agricultural professionals) and student internships, providing logistical support for trainings and conferences, and creating a database of African leadership and capacity building trainings.</p>

                           <p>Africa Lead&rsquo;s goals focus on the achievable objectives of contributing to the increase of the institutional and individual capacity for food security programming. In addition, throughout the three years Africa Lead also has implemented activities that contribute indirectly to the overall goals of FTF and CAADP : <em>Reducing poverty and hunger in focus countries</em> (G1) and <em>Increasing agricultural productivity </em>(G1.1) as is illustrated in the projects Results Framework. (See Appendix V for Africa Lead&rsquo;s Results Framework.)</p>
                           <p>The results framework lays out the project&rsquo;s strategy to both achieve the objectives of the project and contribute to the higher-level goals of FTF and CAADP. Although these two higher level goals are out of the manageable control of the Africa Lead project, Africa Lead has been able to provide needed support to FTF and CAADP&rsquo;s lower level goals of <em>Implementing, funding and approving country investment plans (</em>G1.2) and <em>Improving the performance of key institutions in implementing their CAADP agenda </em>(G1.3).</p>
                           <p>The Africa Lead&rsquo;s strategic objectives (SO) of:</p>

                           </ol>
                           <p>directly support the FTF and CAADP G1.2 and G1.3, which in turn support the overall goals G1 and G1.1. In addition, Africa Lead&rsquo;s strategic objectives are also supported by the project&rsquo;s lower level intermediate results, which are illustrated in the causal chain of the results framework (see Appendices).&nbsp;</p>

In addition, other Africa Lead team members from the implementing partners based in the Washington, DC area (MSI, TRG, WI), provide some of the technical support for institutional capacity assessments, curriculum design (especially the initial development of the signature Africa Lead &ldquo;product,&rdquo; the Champions for Change leadership training), internships and short trainings, the short course database, and the lessons learned research.</p>
                           <p>Primary responsibility for program activity in the field lies with the regional offices located in Africa, each managed by a Deputy Chief of Party (DCoP), who functions as the Regional Program Director. (See Appendices for organizational chart.)</p>
                           <p>Originally there were three offices: The West Africa regional office in Accra, Ghana, The Southern Africa regional office in Pretoria, South Africa and the East Africa regional office, based in Nairobi, Kenya. However, in July 2012, the third office in South Africa was closed and responsibility for all Southern Africa activities was assumed by the Nairobi, Kenya office, which became the East and Southern Africa (ESA) office.</p>
                           <p>Africa Lead was initially set up with funds from USAID/Africa in Washington, as well as the East Africa, West Africa and Southern Africa Missions. However, the project is designed so that all USAID bureaus, the three regional Missions and the 12 bilateral Missions of priority FTF countries could easily &ldquo;buy-in&rdquo; for specific services from Africa Lead, which most did. Although this involves some challenges and complexity and requires a great deal of flexibility within each of the Africa Lead offices, it has allowed the project to meet the specific needs of the Missions and work collaboratively with them to adjust the activities to achieve desired results. This flexibility and responsiveness shows throughout the work of Africa Lead and has became one of the main qualities in the program&rsquo;s success.</p>
                           <p>To address the main capacity building needs identified by USAID in designing Africa Lead, the program is organized along four main tasks or service areas, each focusing on different key components of the project designed to support each of its strategic objectives. Each Task area is led by a Task leader, who is then overseen by the COP.</p>
                           <p>Africa Lead&rsquo;s four task areas are:</p>
                           <p>
                           <ul>
                              <li><strong>Task One:</strong> Transformational Leadership Training and CAADP Sensitization</li>
                              <li><strong>Task Two:</strong> Technical and Third Party Training, Conferences and Other Innovative Learning Experiences</li>
                              <li><strong>Task Three:</strong> Institutional Capacity Needs Assessments</li>
                              <li><strong>Task Four:</strong> Database of Technical and Managerial Short Courses on Offer from Universities and Training Institutions</li>
                           </ul>
                          </p>
                           <p>Each of these tasks has several subtasks, programs and activities. For example, Task One includes the design and delivery of leadership and change management training modules, Module One (Champions for Change) and Module Two (Project Design and Rapid Results Approach).</p>
                           <p>Task Two encompasses all of the customized trainings and innovative learning approaches, such as, the Business to Business exchanges (B2B)<span class="infotip" data="These internships were initially called the Agribusiness Leadership Program and were also referred to as senior internships to distinguish them from the typical student or graduate intern">&loz;</span>
                              &nbsp;as well as logistical support for workshops and for participants to attend specialized third-party training courses.
                           </p>
                           <p>Task Three includes all of the institutional and process capacity assessments and Task Four is the development and transfer of the training database.&nbsp;</p>
                           <p>Each of these task areas plays its role in supporting Africa Lead&rsquo;s overall objectives and each of these tasks is described in detail in the following section on Activities along with the results and outcomes for each.</p>

                              <h2>Task One: Transformational Leadership Training and CAADP Sensitization</h2>
                              <h3>Overview and Methodology</h3>
                              <p>The Africa Leadership Training and Capacity Building Program, in particular Task One, is designed largely on the premise of the critical importance and need for leadership and change management training aligned to CAADP. The leadership training is intended to increase knowledge of the principles, approach and goals of CAADP.&nbsp; Equally importantly the training addresses the need for change management and results-based management throughout organizations in the agriculture sector attempting to address the challenges to achieving greater agricultural productivity and food security. With this in mind, Africa Lead has developed and delivered two training modules focused on <strong>leadership</strong> and <strong>rapid results</strong>.</p>
                              <p>The first training, Module One (&ldquo;Champions for Change&rdquo;), was developed soon after the start of the contract in September 2010 and began to be delivered in January 2011. It is a five day course focused on leadership skills that introduce CAADP, the FTF initiative, and some key aspects of strategic planning, leading and managing change, and performance monitoring &amp; evaluation (M&amp;E).</p>
                              
                              <p>The Module One training was followed in October 2011 with the delivery of Module Two, which is designed to teach skills in project and program design and management, monitoring and evaluation methodologies, team building and the Rapid Results Approach (RRA) to support the movement for the implementation of CAADP National Agriculture Investment Plan (NAIP) <span class="infotip" data="The CAADP National Agriculture Investment Plans (NAIPs) are also frequently called the CIPs, for Country Investment Plans.">&loz;</span>. These trainings draw participants from multiple countries and contain sessions focused on leadership skills for food security and CAADP.</p>
                              <p><img src="img/trainings_by_type.png" id="trainings_by_type"  style="height:260px" /></p>
                              <p>Since the goal of Task One is to generate a network of strategically-placed, skilled food security &ldquo;Champions&rdquo; in each country who are informed about, and committed and motivated to engage collectively around CAADP, Africa Lead works closely with Missions, donors and other projects and counterparts to select participants. When the Africa Lead program began in late 2010 and continually throughout the project, the Bureau of Food Security has asked Regional and local Missions and their African counterparts to identify mid-level professionals working in agriculture and food security to participate in a training program to develop leadership skills and knowledge relevant to moving the CAADP process forward at the national level.</p>
                              <p>Although separate Module One and Two training workshops are the main forms through which the leadership and project management skills are provided under Task One, both Modules are also customized, abridged and adapted to meet the needs of the different stakeholders and reach a wider set of audiences.</p>
                              <p>Among the most interesting customizations of the Task One training is the development of abbreviated leadership &ldquo;Super Champions&rdquo; training workshops for senior officials, including parliamentarians, ministers and governors. These generally involve compressing the five day training into one day and were specifically advocated by the Champions who had gone through the longer training. An early reaction on the Champions&rsquo; part was &ldquo;You should be providing this training to our bosses.&rdquo;</p>

                              <p>There are, however a number of permutations of customized Module One and Two training workshops (<span class="highlightimage" data="trainings_by_type">See chart Trainings by Type</span> and for further explanation of additional trainings, see Task Two).</p>
                              <p>Overall the core trainings in Task One are roughly broken down into four categories:</p>
                              <ul>
                                 <li><strong>Module One</strong>: CAADP Champions for Change, a 5-day course about CAADP and leading change.</li>
                                 <li><strong>Module Two:</strong> A second 4- or 5-day course, tailored to each country, developed to equip CAADP leaders to operationalize investment plans (included Rapid Results Approach).</li>
                                 <li><strong>Abbreviated Module One:</strong> Super Champions, a 1-day course condensing key elements of Module One for Parliamentarians, Ministers and Governors.</li>
                                 <li><strong>Customized/Blended Task One Training:</strong> Module One &amp; Two Hybrid</li>
                              </ul>
                              <p>Each Module contributes to the overall project goal of strengthening the leadership and management capacity of African agricultural professionals. All of the modules incorporate approaches designed to change mindsets and views about each person&rsquo;s actual and potential role in food security, and institutional and policy that promote innovative responses to food security.&nbsp; The trainings are designed to help foster leadership networks of food security Champions across the continent to help reinforce a transformed approach to development that is evidence based, strategic and results-focused.</p>
                              <p>Africa Lead, under Task One, has trained 1,781 (1,188&mdash;Male, and 593&mdash;Female) mid- and senior-level professionals in leadership, change and program management, CAADP principles, processes and goals (this number includes participants from Module 1, Module 2, and combined/blended Module 1&amp;2 trainings).</p>
                              <p>CAADP &ldquo;Champions for Change&rdquo; graduates are English or French speakers from 34 countries in sub-Saharan Africa who work across a broad range of agriculture and food security sectors: 44% from the public sector, 29.5% from NGOs and civil society institutions, 13% from the private sector, and 12% from universities and research institutions.</p>

                                 </ul>
                              </blockquote>
                              <p>Module One was launched in January 2011 as a five day course designed to fill the leadership and management gap observed in some agriculture institutions and identify, prioritize and implement strong agriculture policies, investments and programs. The goals of the training are to increase: (1) knowledge of CAADP, (2) participation in CAADP implementation and, (3) leadership and change management skills.</p>
                              <p>In late 2010, Africa Lead&rsquo;s senior trainers and designers completed a draft curriculum and assembled a dozen potential trainers for a three day Training of Trainers (ToT) and curriculum validation in Nairobi. Working together with excellent regional trainers the TOT trainers solicited African examples that ensure maximum impact of the training when rolled out in countries and regions.</p>
                              <p>The Africa Lead senior trainers have taken great care to select regional facilitators/trainers for the workshops who are sensitive, responsive to body language, effective with participants, who ask open-ended questions to bring out and engage participants, and who understand the material on a technical level. The ToT training comprises 40 hours of exercises on an array of topics.  From the ToT group, eight were selected to deliver the Module One leadership and CAADP program sensitization training.</p>

                              <p>One of the most important and critical outputs of the initial sessions was a significant unanticipated benefit of the trainers &ldquo;Africanizing&rdquo; the curriculum during the ToT process.&nbsp; The trainers added and adjusted elements of the training to fit the social context of Africa, which became one of the key contributions to the success and acceptance of the training by the participants. </p>
                              <p>These adjustments include the picture and story of the Little Girl, the Animal Game and the symbolism of filling the African Pot with grain. These elements are most often mentioned in follow up interviews with the participants as having had the greatest impact on them during the training and remain a motivating force that they carry with them even after the training is over.</p>
                              <p>Of particular impact is the image and accompanying exercise of the little girl who is used to reinforce the urgency and effects of food insecurity as well as the long term impact of having insufficient food as a child. In general, the Module One curriculum takes large concepts such as poverty, gender inequality and hunger to a personal level and with the additions from the trainers, like the girl, these topics have had even more of an impact than ever anticipated.&nbsp;</p>
                              <p><img src="img/whatsherstory.png" /></p>
                              <strong>What's her story</strong>
                              <p>Name this little girl.</p>
                              <p>Create her life story from childhood to adulthood, using your assigned overlooked issue:</p>
                              <ul>
                                 <li>How might her gender affect her access to food security throughout her life?</li>
                                 <li>How might her poverty affect her food security?</li>
                                 <li>How might access to and lack of nutritious food affect her life as a growing child and as a mother?</li>
                                 <li>How might climate change affect her family's ability to achieve food security?</li>
                              </ul>
                              <p>Task One uses a highly participatory approach designed using the best practices for adult learning and utilizing the extensive depth of experience and knowledge of the curriculum developers. It also uses a variety of different learning styles, including visual, audial and kinesthetic.</p>

                              <p>Each workshop session includes elements catering to each learning style with breakout sessions for small groups to interact, share and relate content to their own life experience. In most training workshops each session brings together participants from different countries and sectors giving them a platform to share, compare and contrast experiences as they develop personal and country action plans. Most Module One workshops held were residential, which facilitate an extremely important contributor to expansion of professional networks, through &nbsp;participant engagement with one another throughout the training.</p>
                              <p>Overall, the purpose of Module One is to provide leadership training that enables a more effective shared vision around investment programs, secures public and donor funding for priority programs, and drives the CAADP agenda. To help support this, Module One focuses on maintaining a shared vision, and building up a &ldquo;critical mass&rdquo; of champions who constitute a community of practice, and can advocate for the resources and political support to achieve key agriculture and food security goals.&nbsp;</p>

                              <p>Module One was launched in January 2011 and by the end of that year a total of 1,089 Champions had been trained. In subsequent years the &ldquo;Champions for Change&rdquo; training continued to be conducted but the focus switched to Module Two and other customized trainings and internships.</p>
                              <p id="module1_start" class="subreportpoint module1_start">Overall, 1,343 participants (869 males and 474 females) have received <span class="highlightimage" data="module1_regiongender">Module One Champions for Change</span> training by the end of the project. Most of the Champions are from East Africa representing a variety of sectors with 32% from the civil society, 16% from the private sector, 13 % from research/university sectors, and 38% representing Government staff.</p>
                              <p>To understand and communicate how Module One training is affecting participant behavior, following the training Africa Lead administers a Pre and Post Survey in conjunction with the training, as well as sends participants a six month follow up survey by email using a survey application called Survey Monkey.</p><br/>
                              <p><img src="img/module1_regiongender.png" id="module1_regiongender" class="image_right" style="height:250px" /></p>
                              <p>In addition, a small sample (100) of Champions and other stakeholders in Africa Lead have been intensively interviewed to more deeply get at impact, with each interview lasting for more than an hour. This research is presented in the report: <em>Energizing Champions for Food Security: Reflections on What Works, Why, and What are the Challenges.</em></p>

                              <p>Africa Lead has received the results of 1,260 Pre-Surveys and 1,222 Post-Surveys. This contrasts to the lower but still respectable 46% response rate to the Survey Monkey survey in which 622 of the 1,343 Champions responded to the emailed questionnaire six &nbsp;months after taking the training.</p>
                              <p>A total of 98% of participants consider training quality to be excellent or good, with 99% reporting that the usefulness of the content is good or excellent. In the six month follow up survey 52.5% of participants respond that the training is far above the average training, with an additional 33% responding that it is slightly above average (for a total of 85.5% reporting the training to be above average).</p>

                                 "The Africa Lead training, to me it&rsquo;s been such tremendous help. I mean in terms of leadership because I think in the Ghanaian setting we don&rsquo;t place that much important in leadership training or in leadership&hellip;but after the Africa Lead training, I got to understand what is required of a leader to improve my skills as a leader.&nbsp; I learned a lot of things that to me mean how to make decision, how to build consensus, how to filter through and prioritize all of those. I think it had helped me as a leader and also as a business woman."

                              <p>Overall, Module One is considered by participants to be very successful in delivering the content of the training. The majority of participants report that they have improved their knowledge a lot during the training in Advocacy (72%), Strategic Thinking (85%), Leadership (89%), Team Building (84%), and M&amp;E (61%).</p>
                              <p>In addition, according to the six month follow up survey, 84.3% report that they use what they learned in the training more than other trainings they have attended, with 90.2% responding that they have used the leadership or management tools and techniques at their job since the training.</p>
                              <p><img src="img/module2_trainings_sector.png" id="module2_trainings_sector" class="image_right" style="height:250px" /></p>
                              <p>When asked in which area the participants are <span class="highlightimage" data="module2_trainings_sector">using the training</span>, the most common response is leadership and strategic thinking.</p>
                              <p>In addition, 71.8% of respondents have implemented or started to implement their action plan six months after the training, with 24.3% not yet implementing but are still planning on doing so. Of those who have start working on their action plan, 9.6% have completed their action plan and 87.9% have started and are still working on their action plan.</p>
                              <p>One of the main objectives of the Module One training is to educate the participants on CAADP. According to the Pre and Post Surveys there is substantial increase in their knowledge. In the Pre survey participants report that only 8% of them have an extensive understanding of CAADP with another 29% having a moderate understanding of CAADP. These percentages increase by 35 and 18.8 percentage points respectively after the training to 43% who understand CAADP extensively and 47.8% who have a moderate understanding of CAADP.</p>
                              <p>When participants are asked in the six month follow up survey what they have done differently because of the training -- how their behavior has changed -- there is a variety of responses including a farmer reporting that after the training he turned his farm into a business and someone noting how she has adopted the team building strategies to use at work. Others explain how they have been involved in food security advocacy with their local government, while others are conducting trainings. In general many of the participants talk about how their level of understanding and commitment to addressing food security, malnutrition and gender has increased.</p>
                              <p class="subreportpoint energizing_end">Some express having a new sense of commitment to their work, &ldquo;I have become more passionate and aggressive in implementing my ideas&rdquo;. Others have started to include a broader range of stakeholders and partners in their work to expand the food security network or simply have begun to use their improved planning and management skills at work.</p>
                              <p>When delivering any type of training the hope is that the participant will find the content useful and adopt the practices, but beyond this, the idea that the training can be passed on to other individuals is an extra benefit. The momentum of the Africa Lead Leadership training encourages participants to share their knowledge with others. Fifty-one percent of respondents (235 participants) report that they have conducted training since participating in the &ldquo;Champions for Change&rdquo; Module One training; of these 75% use some of the Africa Lead material. On average these participants have delivered 3.5 trainings to an average of 103 people.</p>
                              <p class="subreportpoint module1_end">In addition to this, 59.4% report having shared the &ldquo;Champions for Change&rdquo; material in a formal or informal conference or meeting, thereby extending the reach of the Africa Lead Module One training through their cascade training and sharing, and providing the foundation for scaling up the Champions for Change to a critical mass.&nbsp;</p>
                              <p>The results from the Pre and Post training surveys suggest participants acquire the skills and motivation to promote food security. Participants come out of the training with a positive momentum and awareness of food security, leadership and strategic thinking. For many this momentum continues on after the training.</p>
                              <p>The Module One training is examined in greater detail in the accompanying report: <em>Energizing and Re-Energizing Champions for Change for Food Security: Lessons Learned from Africa Lead Leadership Training</em>.&nbsp;</p>
                              <h3>Module Two: Project Design and Rapid Results Approach</h3>
                              <h4>Module Two Overview</h4>
                              <p>To supplement Module One, Module Two was initially designed to be more of a technical course on specific skill sets identified both during Module One trainings and institutional capacity assessment in Task Three.</p>
                              <p>Module Two was to be delivered to a sub-set of Module One graduates, however it became apparent that this course needed to be tailored to fit the needs of each Mission and for this reason the designers in Washington, DC came up with a four day course outline which includes the powerful Rapid Results Initiative (RRI) and mixed, matched and added sessions for a five day course to suit specific needs and requirements for FTF partners.</p>
                              <p>Module Two focuses on management and process skills needed to implement and accelerate initiatives to transform agriculture and achieve food security. This is intended to build on Module One&rsquo;s focus on nurturing leaders who are motivated and able to spearhead change processes in their organizations, institutions and wider communities.</p>
                              <p>Module Two trainings differ from Module One trainings in that they are uniquely one-country focused, including participants from a single country, single set of organizations or single institution, depending on the objective of the training. Similarly, regional Module Two training workshops focus on staff from regional institutions having a role in CAADP plan design, implementation and monitoring.</p>
                              <p>As with Module One, the Module Two curriculum is designed for adult learning and learning styles. Module Two training was launched in the fall of 2011 with a heavy emphasis on the Rapid Result&rsquo;s Institute&rsquo;s Rapid Results Approach (RRA) and creating an action plan.</p>
                              <p>The RRA is a simple but highly choreographed process whereby organizations (or operational units within organizations) develop &ldquo;100 day initiatives&rdquo; -- a set of activities that can be implemented and achieve demonstrable outputs in the first 100 days. Another learning element of the RRA is to challenge participants to develop goals and sub-goals (for their 100 day plans) that are actionable and measurable. This thereby creates a groundswell for the larger initiative that the individual or organization will seek to implement. &nbsp;</p>
                              <p>The RRI sets an ambitious goal to be achieved in 60 to 120 days. The initiative is carried out in three phases &ndash; pre-launch, launch and implementation. Each phase is designed to neutralize common systemic barriers to performance. The provision of coaching support during the implementation phase is an important part of the RRA concept.</p>
                              <p>The three unique elements of a RRI are:</p>
                              <ul>
                                 <li>Ambitious but realistic goals</li>
                                 <li>Encourage innovation from below</li>
                                 <li>Coaching support &ndash; specially trained facilitators</li>
                              </ul>
                              <p>The RRA is designed to help individuals or teams expedite implementation of projects and demonstrate rapid results, showing to themselves and stakeholders the feasibility of the project. It is a tool for increasing organizational performance by setting highly ambitious yet achievable goals that are easily measured/clearly defined, urgent and important and achieve visible results quickly. The training approach uses classroom trainings followed by periodic coaching visits to help participants address challenges to achieving rapid results.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

                              <h3 id="module2_start" class="subreportpoint module2_start">Module Two: Outputs, Outcomes and Results</h3>
                              <p><img src="img/module2_trainings_by_sector2.png" class="float:right;" id="module2_trainings_by_sector2"  style="height:250px" /></p>
                              <p>The Module Two training is provided through both the East/Southern and West Africa offices with a total of 333 
                                 participants being trained to date. Of these 235 are males and 98 are females.  <span class="highlightimage" data="module2_trainings_by_sector2">The majority of the participants </span>
                                 come from non-profit/non-government organizations (41%) and represent 23 
                                 African countries.
                              </p>

                              <p>Although Module Two was originally designed to be delivered as a follow up course to Module One, according to the Pre survey 80% of participants had not taken Module One before taking Module Two (212 out of 261).</p>
                              <p>Similar to Module One, all Module Two participants are asked to fill out both a pre and post survey (331 pre-survey and 313 post-survey). The majority of participants, 99% report that the quality of the training is excellent (59%) or good (40%). In addition, 98% think the usefulness of the training is excellent (56%) or good (42%).</p><br/>
                              <p>Some examples from the follow up survey of how participants are using their training are:</p>
                              <ul>
                                 <li>Setting targets and meeting them at work</li>
                                 <li>Changing the focus of activities to be on results</li>
                                 <li>Improving project management practices</li>
                                 <li>Training others on goals and objectives</li>
                                 <li>Creating a network of more farmers to sell and store grain together</li>
                              </ul>
                              <p>One participant noting the personal aspect of the training and its influence reports: &ldquo;Work using my heart instead of my head. As a result I have created a lot of good relationships with other stakeholders.&rdquo;</p>
                              <p>One of the key elements of the Module Two training is the action plan. At the end of the training 98% of the participants 
                                 are pleased with their action plan and will be implementing their plan. Eighty-two percent think that the Rapid Result 
                                 Approach will be useful to them in the future in designing and implementing projects or programs in agriculture and 
                                 food security.
                              </p>
                              <p>Some of the different types of action plans developed include:</p>
                              <ul>
                                 <li>Raising farmer association membership</li>
                                 <li>Encouraging students to set up their own agriculture businesses</li>
                                 <li>Encouraging farmers and community members to grow sustainable crops</li>
                                 <li>Working to sensitize the government authorities to give priority to CAADP issues</li>
                              </ul>
                              <p class="subreportpoint module2_end">Unfortunately, the follow up survey for the Module Two participants has not received sufficient responses to make it representative. The survey was successfully sent to 226 participants (70 emails bounced) and 58 participants have responded. Although the sample in not representative, it still illustrates the work that the Champions do after the workshop, with 88.2% of the respondents expressing that they have started to implement their action plan, and 84.2% reporting that they have experienced positive benefits from their action plan implementation.</p>
                              <p>Many of the reported challenges of implementation are funding and logistical support. However, 90% of respondents have shared their action plan with their supervisor and/or colleagues and received a positive and supportive reaction. Overall, 47.2% have completed their action plan, 38.9% have begun implementing it and 13.9% have tried but been unable to complete it due to challenges.</p>
                              <p>In addition to learning new skills, the training also provides an opportunity to network with other professionals; 76% of the participants report that the workshop has helped to provide this opportunity that can in the future be beneficial to their work.</p>
                              <p>In West Africa, five out of the nine institutions receiving Africa Lead coaching following Module Two training have implemented their RRI action plans successfully. The other four institutions plan to implement their action plans but state that the lack of financial resources, time, and other unexpected challenges has delayed the process. One example is the team Leader of the University of Ghana College of Agriculture who indicates that she has applied the principles of RRI to set up a financial scheme where she lends money to clients. &nbsp;More analysis of the Module Two training can be found in the report: <em>Champions for Change: Sustaining the Momentum Through Results-Oriented Action Plans</em>.</p>
                              <h3>Other Modules: &nbsp;Customized Module 1 &amp; 2 Training</h3>
                              <p>
                                 There are instances in which it makes more sense to &ldquo;mix and match&rdquo; sessions from Module One and 
                                 Two in order to capture key elements of both in an abbreviated amount of time. The West Africa team did this 
                                 for USAID/Ghana, which entailed organizing customized courses to enhance the leadership, project planning, 
                                 management, monitoring and evaluation, and team building skills to senior and mid-career professionals 
                                 from the Regional Coordinating Council, private sector, civil society and research institutions from the 
                                 seventeen districts of the Northern region of Ghana.
                              </p>

                                 <p>Sessions from Module One are selected that aim at inspiring, energizing and mobilizing innovative leaders, champions, and thinkers in the agriculture field through:</p>
                                 <ul>
                                    <li>Equipping them with new knowledge, skills</li>
                                    <li>New perspectives on food security</li>
                                    <li>Strategies for leading and managing change</li>
                                    <li>Strategic thinking and planning skills</li>
                                    <li>Advocacy skills</li>
                                    <li>Leadership skills</li>
                                    <li>Monitoring and evaluation concepts and practices.</li>
                                 </ul>


                              <p>The main sessions from Module Two selected to further develop participants&rsquo; skills focus on:</p>
                              <ul>
                                 <li>Building implementation capacity, and</li>
                                 <li>Making rapid progress in new projects (the Rapid Results Approach).&nbsp;</li>
                              </ul>
                              <br/><br/>
                              <h3>Module One & Two: Outputs, Outcomes and Results </h3>
                              <p>The Module One &amp; Two training programs were delivered between March and June 2013 with a total of 199 (142 males and 57 females) benefitting from the training. Six different courses have been taught and all trainings have been held in Tamale, Ghana.</p>
                              <p>Although Africa Lead has not been able to conduct a six month follow up survey, according to the Pre and Post surveys from all of the participants (199 for each survey), 99.9% report that the training quality is good or excellent with 99.9% rating the usefulness of the training to be excellent or good.</p>
                              <p>As part of the pre survey, 13% of participants express that they have extensive or moderate understanding of CAADP.&nbsp; This percentage increases by 93 % by the end of the workshop with 96.8% reporting that they have extensive or good understanding of CAADP.</p>
                              <p>With training, it is important that the learned knowledge turns into practice. Although the data from the pre and post survey are limited, 100% express that they want to help their institution participate in CAADP because of the training. And 95% state that they will use the leadership and management tools that they learned at the training a lot in their work.</p>
                              <p>The majority of participants say they are planning on implementing their action plan at their organization. Measuring progress on these plans lies in the future, however with the results of the post training survey the participants feel they have a better understanding of the RRA, CAADP and overall Leadership skills that they can continue to use at their institutions.&nbsp;</p><br/><br/>
                              
                              <h2>Task Two: Technical and Third Party Training, Conferences and Other Innovative Learning Experiences</h2>
                              <h3>Overview and Methodology </h3>
                              <p>The primary purpose of Task Two is to provide logistical and financial support for third party and other customized training workshops, internships and other innovative learning partnerships. This task area includes design, logistical and facilitation support provided by Africa Lead for a wide range of workshops, conferences and meetings related to building capacity in various areas critical to increased agricultural productivity, production and food security in Africa. Because of the regional office experience in and their know-how of coordinating trainings and meetings, sometimes on very short notice, Africa Lead has developed a strong reputation for being responsive and able to &ldquo;pull off&rdquo; complex workshops and conferences successfully.</p>
                              <p>Task Two activities often have been undertaken in response to assessments conducted under Task Three (discussed below) (e.g. CORAF, CILSS, ECOWAS support). Notably, some adjunct training supported by Africa Lead has been identified through the web-based database designed and built-up under Task Four (e.g., Namibia M&amp;E training).</p>
                              <p>The three main activities under Task Two are:</p>
                              <ol>
                                 <li>Internships</li>
                                 <li>Customized trainings</li>
                                 <li>Logistical support for conferences and workshops as well as sponsoring of individual training participants to conferences.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                              </ol>
                              <h3>Internships</h3>
                              <p>One of the innovative aspects of Task Two is the partnering between Africa Lead and U.S., international and African agribusinesses to provide both senior and young professionals hands-on learning experience to overcome technical, managerial and financial challenges to operating agribusinesses.&nbsp;</p>

                              <p>Africa Lead has implemented four <span class="highlightimage" data="internship_by_type">main types of internships</span> &ndash; experiential learning opportunities -- under Task Two:</p>
                              <p>1) Agribusiness Leadership Program (also called B2B exchanges)</p>
                              <p>2) Agricultural Shows</p>

                              <h3 style="clear:both">Agribusiness Leadership Program (B2B) Exchanges</h3>
                              <p><img src="img/intern_hershey.png" id="intern_hershey" class="image_center" style="height:250px" /></p>
                              <p>The Agribusiness Leadership program, also known as the Business-to-Business (B2B) exchanges, is designed to match private sector hosts from more technically advanced companies with participants from enterprises who need technical skill upgrades or innovation to overcome identified challenges.&nbsp; To date the program has placed nominated individuals with companies in Africa, the United States and India.&nbsp; Participants get hands-on learning experiences to take back and apply to directly in their organizations.</p>
                              <p>This is a unique internship program in the sense that the &ldquo;interns&rdquo; are already seasoned agriculture professionals (hence another term for the program being &ldquo;Senior Internships&rdquo;). Because of their experience, participants both learn and share their perspectives, creating an exchange of information beneficial to host and intern alike.</p>
                              <p>The internship placements are designed to be responsive to the top challenges faced by the private sector in participants&#39; home countries, such as processing, food safety, warehousing, marketing, and finance.</p>
                              <p><strong>Hershey Co., USA:</strong> In February 2012, Africa Lead sponsored its first B2B professional intern from the Ethiopian Commodity Exchange (ECX) to attend a seven week intensive internship at the Hershey Company in Pennsylvania.</p>
                              <p>The intern worked with the Commodities Operation Unit, which deals with price risk management, and learned firsthand about how global private sector food companies rely on market intelligence and futures markets to ensure security of supply and hedge their risks against future price increases. During her internship she was able to sit with each commodity buyer/trader to gain each trader&rsquo;s insights about activities in commodity operations.</p>
                              <p>The intern was also able to attend meetings with other department staff, suppliers, and other external business counterparts, thereby gaining a broad understanding of the centrality of the Commodities Operation Unit and how it provides information and strategic guidance to the rest of the company.</p>
                              <p>Hershey personnel similarly report new learning from the experience of hosting an African Lead professional intern. &nbsp;Building relationships with commodity suppliers mitigates risk related to quality, supply and operational efficiencies.</p>
                              <p>Overall, the ECX intern feels that the knowledge she acquired on structured marketing systems, and her exposure to cutting edge ICT systems for structured commodity trading is helping her improve and take ECX&rsquo;s operation to higher level, particularly as the Exchange is rolling out its Futures unit.</p>
                              <blockquote>
                                 <em>"I gained work experience in my area of specialization, able to build professional networks, acquired practical and professional skill and knowledge, and shared expert perspective on commodity derivative (on futures and options). I also learned much beyond the listed items. It opened my eyes and initiated me to review the way I do things. The internship motivated me to continue working diligently."</em>

                              <p><strong>Johannesburg Stock Exchange Limited: </strong>In 2012<strong>, </strong>Africa Lead separately sent four grain trade professionals for three week internships to the Commodity Derivatives Division of the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE). JSE is the largest exchange in Africa, as well as the only African agriculture derivatives market.</p>
                              <p>The four professional interns are from commodity exchanges and grain trading operations in Zambia, Ethiopia, and Kenya. During their internships with JSE the senior interns learned all aspects of sophisticated, modern grain trading from storage to trading to currency issues.</p>
                              <p>Examples of their activities include:&nbsp; meeting with all the key players of the South Africa Futures Exchange (SAFEX) including Banks/Clearing Houses, Brokers/Agents and Traders/Clients as well as service providers such as ICT systems providers. They received firsthand experience in buying and selling and they were able to be part of the JSE team at a system test meeting with their trading system vendor.</p>
                              <p>All senior interns report that the exchange has exceeded their expectations and has been a valuable experience that they can apply to their own organizations. One of the senior interns was also later sponsored to go to the JSE Association of Futures Markets (AFM) Conference in February 2013.</p>
                              <p>In addition, the networking works both ways. JSE&rsquo;s Director of Commodity Derivatives, acknowledges the direct value of hosting professional interns:&nbsp; <em>&ldquo;</em><em>We have learned a lot about what is happening in other countries and are establishing good connections that will build the commodity exchange network.&rdquo;</em></p>
                              <p><strong>Zamindara Farm Solutions:</strong> During the fourth quarter of 2012 and the second quarter of 2013, Africa Lead sent two groups of three senior interns each to India to work with Zamindara Farm Solutions in the Punjab Province for a three week period. The senior interns come from four different countries, Uganda, Rwanda, Liberia, and Tanzania, with varied backgrounds in agricultural equipment leasing, engineering and finance.</p>
                              <p>Zamindara is an agricultural equipment leasing company that provides small farmers access to modern farm machinery at a lower cost, helping to eliminate the need for farmers to take out loans to buy costly equipment that will take them years to repay. The fact that an invitation was extended to host a second cadre of African Lead interns is testament to the value the company places in forging intercontinental relationships.</p>
                              <p>In addition to working closely with Zamindara owners, managers and staff, the senior interns visit manufacturers of machinery, operators of grain markets including a local rice mill that purchases, processes and package paddy rice for wholesale. In one case, this rich experiential learning exchange also included a visit to an industrial training institute.</p>

                              <p>The African professionals participating in the Zamindara internships note the differences in production and processing methods in India vs. Africa. They have focused on learning new approaches to farm machinery leasing spearheaded at Zamindara. From their exposure to Zamindara&rsquo;s business strategies they are applying lessons from the business model of providing profitable mechanization solutions to small farmers.</p>
                              <p>The African participants express a particular appreciation for undertaking the experience in groups, which has allowed them to learn from each other as well as from their Zamindara hosts. The experience has motivated them as a group to discuss how the Punjab context and Zamindara&rsquo;s solutions relate to each of their own country contexts.</p>

                           <p><strong>Uncle Ben&rsquo;s Rice</strong>: In June 2013, a senior intern from Uganda spent two months at the Mars Corporation Uncle Ben&rsquo;s Rice in Greenville, Mississippi, which processes and packages a large variety of dry meals and &lsquo;Ready to Heat Rice&rsquo;. The intern was assigned to the Quality &amp; Food Safety program where she gained hands-on learning experience participating in the program&rsquo;s quality audits conducted to ensure compliance of factory practices. She also observed the application of any necessary corrective actions imposed by the Quality and Food Safety program and the development of recommendations to continuously improve the food safety system.</p>
                           <p>The intern participated in the audit of major suppliers, was able to visit and learn about Mars&rsquo; quality and food safety processes, technologies and equipment, and participated in a number of relevant trainings including: Good Manufacturing Practices, Associate Safety, Good Hygiene and Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) &ndash; for which she is now also a certified trainer.&nbsp;</p>
                           <p id="experiential_start" class="subreportpoint experiential_start">As a result of the exchange the Africa Lead professional intern expresses confidence that she will be able to apply what she had learned to improve the food quality and safety in her workplace.&nbsp; In addition she is looking forward to supporting local food producers in Uganda to add value to their products through product development, quality control, commercialization and marketing of the products and product management. She is planning specifically to reassess the food quality and safety situation at her company, looking at the current practices in place and identifying gaps with HACCP.&nbsp;</p><br/>
                           <h3>Other Internships</h3>
                           <p>Beyond the B2B exchange internships, Africa Lead supports other innovative experiential learning opportunities.</p>
                           <h4>Agricultural Shows</h4>
                           <p>As part of a requested support to Liberia&rsquo;s Cuttington University, Africa Lead conducted an assessment of the College of Agriculture and Integrated Development Studies&rsquo; capacity to organize and manage an agriculture show. The findings of the assessment show that the College needs capacity building in several key areas such as: Planning, Financial Management and Fundraising. In response Africa Lead sponsored six senior interns including two members of the College of Agriculture&rsquo;s Agriculture Show planning committee, two representatives from the Ministry of Agriculture and two agribusiness professionals from Liberia to participate in study visits in Ghana and Kenya.&nbsp; The direct objective of this experiential learning is to observe and learn good practices in agriculture show organization and management.</p>
                           <p>Three senior interns attended the Agriculture Society of Kenya&rsquo;s (ASK) Nairobi International Show for three weeks from September 26 &ndash; October 2, 2011. Leading the study tour/internship was the University&rsquo;s Director of Practical Outreach for Extension and Training. He was accompanied by the CEO of Buchanan Resource and Development Corporation (a Liberian agricultural equipment company), and a representative of the Ministry of Agriculture. The other three senior interns spent sixteen days working and learning from both the AGRIFA and FAGRO show organizers in Accra, Ghana from October 7 &ndash; 22, 2011.&nbsp; The AGRIFA show represents an example of a good public - private partnership with the private sector driving the organization and management of the show.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
                           <h4>Sokoine University of Agriculture (SUA) Internship</h4>
                           <p>The East Africa Office has developed and implemented a university agri-entrepreneur internship in partnership with Sokoine University of Agriculture (SUA).&nbsp; Its express goal is to support graduates of the University&rsquo;s Department of Agricultural Economics and Agribusiness in applying their studies to agricultural business development.</p>
                           <p>Through this program young graduates are matched and placed for six to eight weeks with companies that have been identified by Africa Lead and vetted by SUA professors. Between 2012 and 2013 twenty-four interns were placed with fifteen host companies in Tanzania and nine host companies in Kenya.&nbsp;</p>
                           <blockquote>
                           <em>"The things I learnt are what contributes a successful business. In order to stay in the business and be able to fight the competition, I need the best administration of my business but also good managing. To ensure that I get profit and cut off the losses and shorts, I have to manage financials in a very keen way. Also good relationship with my employees will ensure a good work done."</em>
                           <cite>SUA Intern</cite>
                           </blockquote>
                           <p>Each of the participating students is self selected through SUA&rsquo;s innovative Graduates Entrepreneurship program (SUGECO) in which students develop business plans that are reviewed by a committee which selects the best for funding under a USAID/DCA supported program. Based on the business plans of the 24 interns, Africa Lead negotiates with private firms to host them and helps them see how they could turn the &ldquo;theory&rdquo; of their business plans into practical businesses.</p>
                           <p>The 24 SUA interns placed by Africa Lead are among the agri-entrepreneurs of SUGECO whose submitted business plans were approved for funding. It is important to highlight that many of the businesses hosting these young entrepreneurs are owned or managed by Africa Lead-trained Champions for Change for Food Security. This is another way of integrating and supporting the growing network agriculture professionals.</p>
                           <p>On April 10, 2013, President Jakaya Mrisho Kikwete of the United Republic of Tanzania expressed his support for this program in empowering young graduates while expanding their employment opportunity through hands-on training and experience. The President pledged to contribute $3.5 million (Tsh 5 billion) to the continuation and scale up of the SUGEGO initiative.</p>
                           <h4>CILSS and CORAF Young Professional Internship Programs</h4>
                           <p>In West Africa, Africa Lead has selected and provided logistical support to 10 interns assigned to work with Permanent Interstate Committee for Drought in the Sahel (<em>Comit&eacute; permanent Inter-Etats de Lutte contre la S&eacute;cheresse dans le </em><em>Sahel</em> or CILSS) and the West and Central African Council for Agricultural Research and Development (<em>le Conseil Ouest et Centre africain pour la recherche et le d&eacute;veloppement agricoles</em>, CORAF) for a yearlong internship program. CILSS and CORAF staff tap into the interns&rsquo; recent university education and specializations in key areas identified as gaps in the CORAF and CILSS institutional capacity assessments conducted by Africa Lead (more on this assessment activity in Task Three).</p>
                           <p>The interns help their CORAF and CILSS colleagues resolve problems with new and innovative approaches. The interns are also mentored by staff and contribute in diverse ways to various units and departments of CILSS and CORAF. The interns help strengthen the M&amp;E, Human Resource Management, Knowledge Management and Communication systems in both organizations.</p>
                           <p>Specific tasks include technical assistance to upgrade information technology systems including website and databases; producing public relations materials; and helping improve the marketing of both organizations. The interns collect data and improve the quality of data collection and reporting systems. Those with library science background assist the staff to better organize and catalogue research documents and reports.</p>
                           <h4>NARS Internship Program</h4>
                           <p>NARS Internship Program: Between February and July 2013, Africa Lead commenced an internship program for research institutions in Chad, Nigeria, Cameroon, Liberia and other beneficiary countries including Congo, Ghana, Gabon, Mauritania and CAR. A total of 17 participants attended a four week internship program with CORAF in Senegal to obtain hands-on experiences in research.</p>
                           <p>Africa Lead&rsquo;s West Africa Office provides logistical support for all the internship program beneficiaries.&nbsp; Some of the research institutions include The Institute of Agricultural Research for Development (ITRAD) Chad, National Animal Production Research Institute (NAPRI) Nigeria, Central Agricultural Research Institute (CARI) Liberia, National Roots Crops Research Institution (NRCRI) Nigeria, and the Ministry of Agriculture Department of Agriculture Services Nigeria.</p>
                           <p class="subreportpoint experiential_end">The accompanying report: <em>Experiential Learning Experiences:&nbsp; Lessons Learned from Africa Lead&rsquo;s Senior Business to Business Exchanges and Traditional Internships </em>provides further details and analysis.</p>
                           <h3>Experiential Learning: Outputs, Outcomes and Results </h3>
                           <p>Whatever the type, the experiential internship learning is considered by the participants to be of great value. Many participants in these programs mention gaining practical skills through hands-on experience. They also highlight the insights that come with confronting new challenges and observing new ways of doing things.</p>
                           <p>They report that the collaboration with people from different backgrounds gives them new insight into their own work and their future career goals. Many attest to gaining a new motivation to contribute to food security and state that they have acquired new perspectives and skills that can change the way they work back in their own organizations.</p>
                           <blockquote style="float: left;">
                           <em>"At first I didn&rsquo;t know who was coming, so only offered the internship for 4 weeks, but she brought a lot of benefits to my company, including pushing my staff to do more. She ended up staying 2 months. I then had more interns to follow. They gained experience in processing, marketing, practical skills in working with teams, and meeting funders and NGOs that deal with cassava value chain. They brought knowledge from their schooling and talked to my workers about best practices and how to identify new markets&hellip;At first the staff was resistant, but we needed to help the youth and help us feed the future population. Now my staff asks when we are getting another intern, and they have realized the value of bringing in the intern."</em>

                           </blockquote>
                           <p>Another important result from the internships is the impact they have on host organizations. Some hosts recounted in the Lesson Learned workshop that they had initially been hesitant to take on an intern. They realize in retrospect that the flow of information and ideas goes both ways; that they have learned a great deal from having interns and indicate that they are ready to host more.</p>
                           <p>&nbsp;Although highly varied in length, type of host and type of intern, the internships have proven to be positive experiences for both the host and participant. They are successful in teaching participants skills through practical experience, challenging them to gain skills and knowledge about their role in food security. They also force host companies to think more deeply about why they do things in certain ways and whether these are the best ways.</p>
                           <br/>
                           <h3>Customized Training</h3>
                           <p>The premise of Africa Lead is to lead with leadership, change management and CAADP training &ndash; supporting a cadre of Food Security Champions -- and then to follow with technical and other training as requested by USAID or as identified through institutional capacity assessments conducted by the program itself. The main two examples of these customized trainings are the Non-State Actor (NSA) workshops and the CORAF and CILSS- training program. Both are described below, along with other ad hoc trainings that Africa Lead supports.&nbsp;</p>
                           <h4>Non-State Actor’s Workshop</h4>
                           <p>As part of USAID support to the CAADP process, in 2011 Africa Lead developed a three day training to help civil society and the private sector engage productively with the government in the CAADP process. Africa Lead worked with the CAADP NSA Task Team and with national NSA leadership to jointly conduct a series of national-level NSA (community-based, academic, media, private sector organizations) workshops aimed at increasing and improving the quality of involvement of NSAs in the CAADP National Agriculture Investment Plan implementation process.</p>
                           <p>Driving these training workshops is the realization that NSAs are not fully participating in the development and implementation of National Agricultural Investment Plans (NAIPs); they are not involved in setting of priorities for agricultural investments, and NSA involvement in oversight is weak. CAADP recognizes that to transform African agriculture it is imperative to build broad and inclusive coalitions, which requires more inclusion of NSAs, especially poor and marginalized groups.</p>
                           <p>The CAADP NSA Task Team includes a number of international and regional NGOs working together to strengthen the voice of civil society and the private sector in agriculture policy and programming. The Task Team has taken the lead in the training workshops that Africa Lead supports.</p>
                           <p>The Africa Lead-supported workshops provide training and an open forum for discussion, collaboration, and action planning. The main desired outcomes of the NSA workshops are to build a coalition of non-state actors interested in productively engaging in national and regional CAADP processes and actions; strengthen communication and consultation among NSA constituencies; and ensure inclusion of underrepresented groups. As part of the workshop, participants also develop group action plans that align the participants behind common objectives, create ownership, and detail concrete steps in high priority areas to boost engagement and hold CAADP partners accountable.</p>
                           <h4>NSA: Outputs, Outcomes and Results</h4>
                           <p><img src="img/nsa_trainings.png" id="nsa_trainings" class="image_right" style="height:188px" /></p>
                           <p>There have been a total of 706 (490 males and 216 females) participants trained in the NSA workshops. Most of the participants are from non-government or non-profit organizations (<span class="highlightimage" data="nsa_trainings">see chart</span>) and were trained in 2011 (453). To determine the effectiveness of the NSA training a pre and post survey (518 responses out of 706 participants) is given as well as a six month follow up survey that is sent to participants through the Survey Monkey.</p>
                           <p>In the post survey, 92% of participants report that what they learned and discussed at the training will be useful in their work. Ninety-seven percent of participants report that the training has done an excellent (61%) or good job (37%) in teaching them why NSA involvement in CAADP matters. An impressive 99% of trainees report an increased desire to participate in CAADP after receiving training, with 95% of the participants reporting that they have increased their knowledge of CAADP by attending the training.</p>
                           <p>Beyond educating the NSA participants about the importance of their involvement with CAADP, the training workshops also bring different NSA groups together laying the groundwork for them to create food security stakeholder networks and joint action plans for engagement with government. Going into the workshops, participants reported on average knowing 34% of the other participants professionally.&nbsp; This increased to 69% at the end of the workshop. Of those who responded to the six month follow up survey, 33% have completed their action plan and 60% have started the implementation and are still working on it.</p>
                           <p>The NSA workshops have been conducted in 11 countries (Rwanda, Tanzania, Uganda, Liberia, Mali, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Senegal, Zambia and Zimbabwe). During the Africa Lead Lessons Learned Workshop in June 2013, the NSA representative reported that motivation and energy on the part of participants in the NSA training workshops continues but also admitted that not as much has been done as can be.</p>

                           <p>At the request of USAID/West Africa, Africa Lead has conducted institutional assessments for the Permanent Interstate Committee for Drought in the Sahel (Comit&eacute; permanent Inter-Etats de Lutte contre la S&eacute;cheresse dans le <em>Sahel</em> or CILSS) and the West and Central African Council for Agricultural Research and Development (<em>le Conseil Ouest et Centre africain pour la recherche et le d&eacute;veloppement agricoles</em> or CORAF) to help gain a better understanding of these two organizations&rsquo; capacity development needs (see Task Three).</p>
                           <p>The findings and recommendations from the assessment led to the development of a &ldquo;Bridge Capacity Development Plan&rdquo; (BCDP or Capacity Development Plan) for each organization that was completed in March 2011.&nbsp; Through a competitive bidding process Africa Lead selected regional training institutions to design and deliver the customized courses of the Capacity Development Plan to address the organizational needs and gaps identified in the capacity assessments.</p>
                           <p>Africa Lead regional trainers, along with MDF Training and Consultancy, G&amp;A Business Solutions, and The Pan African Organization for Sustainable Development (POSDEV) &ndash; regional training organizations &ndash; have designed the course curriculum, prepared the resource materials and delivered the short courses to selected staff of the two research organizations. The Africa Lead team also provides follow up technical assistance and coaching support to the two institutions to strengthen classroom training with on-the-job training. This support focuses on monitoring and evaluation tools such as establishment of performance monitoring plans.&nbsp;</p>
                           <h4>CORAF and CILSS: Outputs, Outcomes and Results</h4>
                           <blockquote>
                           <em>"Africa Lead&lsquo;s training has combined short courses and follow up which has been very special for us. We have had many training programs, but not the same, didn&rsquo;t allow them to develop their own plan and put into action."</em>
                           <cite>CORAF Representative (Africa Lead Lessons Learned Conference June 2013)</cite>
                           </blockquote>
                           <p>Between October 2012 and May 2013 Africa Lead delivered 21 courses to 158 CORAF and CILSS staff from 20 countries. During the Africa Lead Lessons Learned Conference in June 2013, CORAF and CILSS representatives shared their experience with the BCDP.</p>
                           <p>The CORAF representative avows that the training program has been a turning point for CORAF, highlighting the need for and the techniques to focus on achieving and measuring results. As a consequence of the training there have been behavior changes within the CORAF staff. Both CORAF and CILSS representatives highlight the value of the continuity of Africa Lead involvement, from assessment to design and implementation of a capacity building program.</p>
                           <p>They feel that often this extra support is not given and it is key to ensuring that the needed recommendations are implemented into the organization. CORAF and CILSS are happy with the results of the BCDP and feel that this support for their staff capacity will continue to help them in the future.&nbsp;</p>
                           <h4>Review of the Bridge Capacity Development Program </h4>
                           <p>To help determine the impact of the CORAF and CILSS training program, Africa Lead has hired MDF Training and Consultancy to carry out a review/lessons learned assessment of the program. Findings from the assessment are expected to help identify how the training has contributed to measureable institutional improvements, and will serve as a guide to future projects organized by Africa Lead.</p>
                           <p>In general the training program has been well received by CORAF and CILSS and has significantly contributed to increased knowledge and skills in a number of domains. Some of the general recommendations from the assessment include:</p>
                           <ul>
                           <li>Ensuring that trainings are sufficiently related to the working environment of participants and organized in such a way that participants can immediately start to implement their acquired knowledge and skills.</li>
                           <li>Follow up to a training afterward in important.&nbsp;</li>
                           <li>Training courses have often been considered as too short; instead of a 2 or 3-day training most participants would have preferred five day trainings.</li>
                           <li>A future training program of this size could preferably be spread over a longer time period. There seemed to be some training-tiredness at the end of the program, since a lot of trainings were organized within a rather short period of time.</li>
                           <li>The training program should become part of the institutional learning curriculum. Furthermore, it is suggested to give training to both individual and collective more institutional attention by linking it to career and professional development.</li>
                           <li>Besides offering more in-depth and specialized training, some of the most successful trainings could be offered again to extend them to all relevant staff.</li>
                           <li>In order to ensure optimal results, a training could also be foreseen in two parts: a first training where &lsquo;homework&rsquo; by means of an action plan or project at short notice is developed, then a period where participants practice and apply their action plan in their own working environment, followed by a follow up workshop and training to reflect upon results and to plan for the future, eventually combined with training on some additional topics.</li>
                           </ul>
                           <h3>Other Trainings and Conferences:</h3>
                           <p>In addition to Africa Lead&rsquo;s &ldquo;flagship&rdquo; leadership and project management training (Task One Modules One and Two), the program has initiated a wide range of other innovative training events and supported many workshops and conferences aimed at driving the transformation of agriculture that is central to CAADP and FTF. With buy-in from the Missions, Africa Lead often has been requested to provide agenda design, event planning, management, logistics, funding and facilitation design and delivery to a wide range of meetings held by USAID Missions.</p>
                          <p>
                            These events run the gamut of regional policy planning process development (for SAKSS with IFPRI) to government-to-government M&E training (for Tanzania with USAID).  The convenings also range from intergovernmental food security coordination (G8 New Alliance) to country-level agricultural capacity building (technical forum for Kenya’s new governors).  Among the specific topics covered are aflatoxin control, drought resilience frameworks, agribusiness development and stakeholder engagement. Further detail is contained in the Appendices section.

                           <h4>Participants Supported to Conferences, Trainings and Workshops</h4>
                           <p>In addition to helping to design, plan, fund and facilitate conference and meetings, Africa Lead has also sponsored individual participants to conference, workshops and courses across Africa and the world. This includes the range of assistance including helping to secure visas, tickets and hotels, course fees, etc.</p>
                           <p>Ministry of Agriculture personnel have been supported to attend short courses in specialized fields, such as Nigerian and Ghanaian officials to Namibia to study Monitoring and Evaluation at the Institute for Capacity Development and ReSAKSS representatives to the University of East Anglia’s International Development Department in the UK.  University researchers have been supported to participate in a wide array of conferences focusing on issues including nutrition, fertilizer, commodity futures markets, seeds and crop productivity through Africa Lead facilitation.</p>
                           <p>In addition, veterinary personnel, including Chief Veterinary Officers (CVOs), have traveled from Kenya and South Sudan to the U.S. to study at the Center for Epidemiology and Animal Health of the USDA and others have met with USDA’s Animal and Plant Inspection Service (APHIS) as well as with ranchers and other counterparts to discuss disease control protocols and modern ranching techniques.</p>

                           <h2>Task Three: Institutional Capacity Needs Assessments</h2>
                           <p>The purpose of Task Three is to conduct needs assessments of key institutions to identify their critical processes in achieving agriculture transformation, as well as their gaps and capacity building needs to strengthen the institution and their processes. Training and other capacity building can then be provided based upon the needs identified in the assessments. The trainings may be those identified in the Task Four database or found elsewhere as well as training designed by Africa Lead itself or partners working with the program.&nbsp;</p>
                           <p>Two main types of assessment have been conducted:</p>
                           <ul>
                           <li><strong>Institutional</strong> assessments, including assessments of the management of CAADP programs and</li>
                           <li><strong>Policy process</strong> assessments, which provide a cross-sector and multi-organization review of a country&rsquo;s capacity to manage policy change.</li>
                           </ul>
                           <h3>Institutional Assessments:</h3>

                           <p>The purpose of these assessments is to examine what technical, managerial and process skills are needed to strengthen specific institutions or groups of institutions in moving agriculture forward and advancing the CAADP agenda. The assessments are also to suggest priorities and sequences of capacity building that will best strengthen the target institutions or institutions.</p>
                           <p>The particular assessment methodology used varies depending on the nature of the organizations. Therefore Africa Lead has developed several methodologies for conducting organizational assessments. 
                           In general the same institutional functional capacity areas are reviewed under each assessment. These include:</p>
                           <ul>
                           <li>Governance</li>
                           <li>Leadership</li>
                           <li>Planning, including strategic and annual work planning</li>
                           <li>Data analysis and results reporting</li>
                           <li>Financial management and financial viability</li>
                           <li>Staffing structures in relation to programs and mission</li>
                           <li>Management systems, including personnel and administrative management</li>
                           </ul>
                           <strong>Within the institutional capacity assessments there are multiple types of assessments that are conducted, including:</strong>
                           <ol>
                           <li>Detailed assessments of individual institutions;</li>
                           <li>Assessments of the CAADP process and of CAADP coordination units; and</li>
                           <li>Program-wide area assessments.</li>
                           </ol>
                           <h3>Overview of Institutional Assessments Conducted</h3>
                           <strong>Assessments of Individual Institutions</strong>

                           <strong>Program-wide Area Assessments</strong>
                           <p><strong>Institutional Mapping and Assessment of Northern Ghana Institutions Relevant to USAID Feed the Future Program: </strong>This mapping of the key actors operating in the Ghanaian agricultural landscape highlights prerequisite capacities for initiating the capacity development component of the Feed the Future (FTF) Initiative&rsquo;s support for modernizing Ghana&rsquo;s agricultural sector.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
                           <h3>Policy Assessments (“Institutional Architecture” Assessments)</h3>
                           <p>In collaboration with the USAID Enhancing Agricultural Trade (EAT) Project, Africa Lead has developed the Institutional Architecture for Food Security Policy Change assessment methodology (IAA). Since early 2013 this approach has been applied to conduct eight country-level and one Regional Economic Community (REC)-level analyses.</p>
                           <p>The purpose of these assessments is to determine a country&rsquo;s capacity to undertaken food security policy reform. They have been undertaken to provide the USAID Bureau of Food Security, USAID missions, local policymakers, and other key stakeholders with initial, &ldquo;first cut&rdquo; information on possible constraints that could stymie effective policy change.</p>
                           <p>Once completed, the analysis can be used to design technical assistance and other support to address constraints and improve the policy capacity process.&nbsp; The assessments focus on areas of transparency, predictability, inclusiveness and evidence-based analysis and have been conducted for the agriculture policy processes in Ethiopia, Ghana, Tanzania, Malawi, Mozambique, Rwanda, Zambia, Democratic Republic of the Congo, and the East Africa Community <span class="infotip" data="The EAT project has co-conducted the Ethiopia IA assessment and conducted the assessments in Senegal, Uganda and Liberia (forthcoming).">&loz;</span>.</p>
                           <p>The IAA assessment methodology contains two main components: (1) an institutional mapping process, which identifies the main institutions involved in a policy change process; and (2) an assessment of a country&rsquo;s capacity to undertake food security policy reform, as per the main elements of a policy development or change process.&nbsp;</p>
                           <blockquote style="display:block;width:350px;float:right;"
                           <p>For each of the six policy change elements examined a series of indicators has been developed. These indicators define the characteristics that are required for each element to be successfully implemented.&nbsp;</p>
                           <ul>
                           <li>Policy Element 1: Predictability of the Guiding Policy Framework</li>
                           <li>Policy Element 2: Policy Development and Coordination</li>
                           <li>Policy Element 3: Inclusivity and Stakeholder Consultation</li>
                           <li>Policy Element 4: Evidence-based Analysis</li>
                           <li>Policy Element 5: Policy Implementation</li>
                           <li>Policy Element 6: Mutual Accountability</li>
                           </ul>
                           </blockquote>
                           <p id="assessments_start" class="subreportpoint assessments_start">The assessment is primarily a qualitative process; ratings are provided on the general level of achievement for each indicator using a three-color stoplight rating system. The meaning of the ratings is as follows:</p>
                           <ul class="inlinedlist">
                            <li><strong>Red:</strong> requires significant attention to ensure the component is achieved.</li>
                            <li><strong>Yellow:</strong> Progress is mixed. The conditions required to achieve the component are partially achieved, but additional attention is required.</li>
                            <li><strong>Green:</strong> The component is realized to a sufficient degree, and additional attention to this area is not required at this time.</li>
                           </ul>

                           <p>In addition to the color ratings, each assessment includes narrative text to support each rating. At the end of each of the &ldquo;policy element&rdquo; sections recommendations are included that suggest assistance or process changes that can be undertaken to improve policy change capacity.</p>
                           <h3>Assessments: Outputs, Outcomes and Results</h3>
                           <p>From the variety and number of assessments that Africa Lead has conducted there are many findings. Many of these are specific and relevant to the individual institution; however some of the results are cross cutting. Findings from both the individual institutional assessments and findings from the policy assessments are explained below.</p>
                           <p>A full description and encapsulation of the findings of assessments done to date is contained in the companion report: <em>Africa Lead Capacity Needs Assessments of African Institutional and Policy Processes: Guiding Achievement of CAADP Goals.</em></p>
                           <h3>Individual Institutions</h3>
                           <p>For the overall institutional findings the assessments find that in general many of the organizations lack adequate systems that use results-based management, and therefore lack clear program objectives, performance indicators, and use of performance monitoring and reporting systems to review performance and improve program management.</p>
                           <p class="subreportpoint assessments_end">An additional element in short supply that could help fill these gaps is the need for updated Information, Communication and Technology systems, including knowledge management systems.&nbsp; While important for all institutions, this is particularly important for research and regional institutions.&nbsp;</p>
                           <p>Another overall finding is the need for additional and more workforce development/human resource management systems. To support this, the general finding is that the institutional assessments should be used as a basis for prioritizing and offering program-wide training and support.&nbsp; Training, and follow up technical assistance, should be offered in strategic planning, monitoring and evaluation, results-based management, knowledge management, fundraising, and outreach and communications. This has been done with CORAF and CILSS and been found to be very successful.</p>
                           <p>In relation to CAADP, there is a need for training and technical assistance to strengthen the participation and capabilities of civil society and private sector associations. Part of this is the need for high-level government support to CAADP success.&nbsp; The CAADP programs that have advanced the furthest in terms of implementation are those that have received consistent high-level political support.</p>
                           <p>National food security priorities should be in alignment with donor programs.&nbsp; The CAADP coordinating committee should be closely linked to government-donor coordination so program objectives, budget allocations, reporting measures, and review processes are aligned.</p>
                           <p>In addition, detailed and aligned implementation plans are required.&nbsp; Task forces/working groups are required to develop CAADP implementation plans, and to move forward policy reforms.&nbsp; Higher-level committees are required to develop broad objectives, and to coordinate among and between programs, but in order to produce the work plans and to implement programs, working-level groups and detailed plans are required.&nbsp;</p>
                           <p>And lastly, private sector participation remains a challenge for many CAADP teams and private sector participation is low in most CAADP programs.&nbsp; The assessments suggest that AU/CAADP should provide additional assistance to countries in how to strengthen NAIP implementation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
                           <h3>Policy Capacity Assessments: Africa Lead Overall Findings</h3>
                           <p>To determine how different countries rate in terms of their overall capacities to manage a policy change process the stoplight scoring system &ndash; green, yellow and red ratings &ndash; is converted to number scores. 
                           By converting these scores to number it is possible to review the following for the countries that have undergone IAA 
                           assessments:</p>
                           <ul>
                              <li>The relative strength of various countries&rsquo; capacities across the six policy change elements</li>
                              <li>How that capacity of individual countries relate to one another</li>
                              <li>Overall, and across countries, the policy elements that appear to be strongest, and those most in need of strengthening</li>
                              <li>The individual indicators of policy capacity (there are multiple indicators for each capacity element) that scored highest and lowest across the countries assessed</li>
                           </ul>

                           <p>In general, the scores for individual country assessments, and the elements and indicators provide an overview of the strength and weakness of policy change capacity for particular countries, and for elements and indicators across the countries scored.&nbsp; However, it is suggested this information be used as general assessment guidance and, when possible, considered along with other available information.</p>
                           <p>The policy systems and change process can vary significantly from country to country, and can vary among policy reform processes within the same country &ndash; making direct comparisons from country to country somewhat inexact. Nonetheless, certain patterns emerge.&nbsp; For example, the studies suggest that promoting evidence-based analysis and inclusive stakeholder participation are the two policy elements that appear to need the most support.</p>
                           <p><em>Caveat lector</em>: It should be noted that the various elements and indicators are not weighted as to importance.&nbsp; Additionally, while the ratings do produce comparative scores, the assessment process is primarily qualitative so it is not a scientifically objective process.&nbsp; Despite these concerns, we believe the analysis does provide useful guidance for helping to identify future technical assistance priorities.</p>
                           <h2>Task 4: Database of Technical and Managerial Short Courses on Offer from Universities and Training Institutions</h2>
                           <h3>Overview and Methodology</h3>
                           <p>Africa Lead&rsquo;s fourth task is developing a database of training institutions and technical short courses related to agricultural and management sciences that can be matched to the leadership training and capacity building needs relevant to African agriculture professionals.</p>
                           <p>The purpose of this element of the program is to facilitate the process of finding course offerings in Africa that can respond to the capacity building needs already known to exist or that are identified during the schedules of Task One trainings and Task Three capacity assessments. Additionally, it is meant to ensure a sustained dynamic process in which the African institutions providing training can tailor their offerings to the actual demands of individuals and institutions working to strengthen agriculture productivity for sustained food security throughout Africa.</p>
                           <p>Mustering the technical skills to create a user-friendly, smoothly operating online database is the easy part for a consortium such as Africa Lead. &nbsp;The two primary challenges, as with any database are: (1) to build something that does what the users of the data need it to do and, (2) to make it work effectively within the technical limitations of where it will be used.</p>
                           <p>Much attention has gone into building the database so that it can be managed and accessed from any browser. In determining the searchable fields and subject area topics for course selection, Africa Lead has worked closely with other organizations such as the German Government&rsquo;s InWEnt (Capacity Building International) and the United Nation&rsquo;s Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), who are also working to build capacity development databases for the continent.</p>
                           <p>A <span class="highlightimage" data="task4_people_layout">technical snapshot</span> of the Africa Lead database of Short courses allows Super Administrators (those with software-designing skills) and Administrators (those facile with operating the software) are able to use the Administrator Dashboard to: </p>

                           <ul>
                              <li>View site analytics such as search keywords and number of registered users</li>
                              <li>Identify trends</li>
                              <li>View results from registered users needs assessments</li>
                              <li>Identify needs and use the data when developing training courses</li>
                              <li>Generate and email reports related to site usage and needs assessments</li>
                           </ul>
                           <br/><br/>
                           <p>To serve Champions and others, the database needs to be current and to contain reliable information on relevant course offerings.&nbsp; To that end, the Africa Lead database developers have provided training to the regional offices for data entry, review and validation. A vetting system has been established to make sure that the data entered into the database are accurate.</p>
                           <p>The Africa Lead database aims to achieve the following impacts:</p>
                           <ul>
                              <li><strong>Increased Awareness of Courses Offered: </strong>Africa Lead identifies available courses at universities and training organizations in West, East, and Southern Africa, as well as relevant courses elsewhere in the world, and inputs this into a dynamic, interactive database that can be easily updated.&nbsp; This increases access to information and strengthens the ability of organizations to source information on what institutions and training courses are available and the location of those organizations and course schedules.</li>
                              <li><strong>Knowledge about Training Institutions and the Quality of Services: </strong>Africa Lead ensures that courses in the database are high quality and are applicable to the needs of African leaders. Organizations requiring training services have access to verified data on the quality of the short courses and capacity of the training institutions offering services.</li>
                              <li><strong>Matchmaking Tool for the Design of New Training Courses and for Sending Professionals on Short-Term Courses</strong>:&nbsp; The database provides a targeted directory of options for those seeking training and education in areas critical to CAADP implementation. Capacity gaps and individuals needing training are identified through assessments, leading institutions to either seek a short course or design an appropriate training program to respond to their needs.</li>
                           </ul>
                           <p>The database is designed to facilitate the matching of technical and management or leadership skill needs identified by organizations involved in the CAADP process at all levels, with appropriate short course offerings that can be funded either by donors or by the additional national budget that is expected to be dedicated to agriculture.</p>

                           <p>The listed courses are offered primarily by post-secondary institutions and training organizations based on the continent. &nbsp;However, where technical training key to scaling up food security may only be available outside, courses offered in collaborating countries are also listed.</p>
                           <p>In building the short course database, Africa Lead has always considered the question of sustainability and finding a long-term home for the courses. The objective for Africa Lead is to continue to identify courses and make the list of courses available to potentially interested parties, likely beneficiaries, as well as likely funders.</p>
                           <p>To ensure future sustainability Africa Lead has negotiated a grant agreement with Open Educational Resources (OER) South Africa, which became the host in September 2012.&nbsp; OER Africa continues to build upon the short course database and facilitates the ongoing development of agricultural professionals, students and other stakeholders working in the agricultural sector.</p>
                           <p>Currently, the database is being publicized widely not only to graduates of the Africa Lead Champions for Change courses but to many other high ranking personnel in government positions, faculty, non-governmental organizations and other interested persons.</p>
                           <p>Beginning December 2012, OER Africa in conjunction with the Regional Universities Forum for Capacity Building in Agriculture (RUFORUM) has traveled around and trained staff and students at 19 universities across Eastern and Southern Africa (in Ethiopia, Kenya, Lesotho, Uganda, Tanzania, Malawi, Zambia, Zimbabwe and Swaziland) in how to use the Africa Lead Database.&nbsp; This phase of the project aims to introduce institutions to the database and to teach individuals there how to upload information about their course offerings and therefore increase their dissemination. A total of 25 institutions (in Kenya, Malawi, Tanzania, Uganda, Ethiopia, Lesotho, Swaziland, Mozambique, Rwanda and South Africa) have been invited to participate.</p>

                           <p>In general, the database has continued to add courses and the usership has shown potential growth. From December 2012 to 30 September 2013 over 3,500 people have visited the database with 80.67% of the users being first time visitors and 19.2% being return visitors. Most visits to the site are from South Africa, which may be linked to the fact that the top course providers are also from South Africa and Namibia.</p>
                           <p>The average visit duration to the database is 3 minutes and 23 seconds and there is a bounce-rate of 60.88% which is rather high and needs further interrogation to determine the cause of why visitors are not choosing to click on further links and explore the website.</p>
                           <p>Of the top twenty course contributors eight are higher education institutions with the others being from training organizations involved in development. The majority of these contributors are from Africa, however there are some contributors from countries such as the United States of America, United Kingdom and Malaysia.</p>

                           <p>The outreach approach gives publicity to the ongoing short professional courses offered. The universities that are being visited have ongoing short courses that are relevant for sharing within the network but many have no central place to host or advertise the courses, nor is there often someone to push this content/information online.</p>
                           <p>OER finds working with RUFORUM as a partner to be extremely beneficial.&nbsp; It has facilitated easier identification of and access to the participating institutions and thus a better response has been obtained from the RUFORUM member institutions as opposed to those that are not. As part of this OER recommends moving the database to RUFORUM or OER Africa websites, which would allow all the available agriculture open education resources and the short course information to be accessed in one place, rather than for it to be a standalone site which requires more effort to maintain and advertise.</p>
                           <p>The training component of the project (implemented December 2013 to February 2013) indicates that while well received, actively engaging with the database is not without its challenges, for example, not all African higher education institution staff have regular access to Internet or up-to-date software or laptops and so alternative ways have been devised to train them to learn about and use the database. For this reason, a template to collect course information has been developed that can be filled in easily on one&rsquo;s computer using a word processing package or printed out for a person to complete manually, scan and submit. This sort of tool is proving very useful when training at sites where connectivity and access to suitable hardware and software is limited.</p>
                           <p class="subreportpoint database_end">Targeting of the right institutional staff members also is critical in ensuring buy-in and participation. Another important factor is the time of year to visit the institutions as holidays and school schedules need to be considered.</p>
                           <p>There also are some challenges in <em>identifying and getting permission for the right people to be trained</em> &ndash; in some instances the associated bureaucratic red tape and hierarchical institutional protocol creates bottlenecks, barriers and delays.</p>
                           <p>More analysis of the near term scope of the database can be found in the report: <em>Africa Lead Database Use: Report on Lessons Learnt</em>.</p>
                           <p>Challenges notwithstanding, the database serves as a valuable resource that will ensure that some of the courses offered by Africa&rsquo;s and other regions&rsquo; finest agricultural institutions will be rendered highly visible to ensure their widespread dissemination and usage.</p>

                           <h3>Lessons Learned from Africa Lead</h3>
                           <p>Africa Lead has emphasized learning throughout the implementation of the project. As an early capacity building project under FTF the Africa Lead team is very aware of its &ldquo;trailblazing&rdquo; and catalytic role in coming up with innovative and productive ways to support capacity building for agricultural transformation in Africa.</p>
                           <p><img src="img/lessons_beans.png" id="lessons_beans" class="image_right" style="height:300px" /></p>
                           <p>This intense learning ethos has manifested itself through the flexible approach that the project takes, always ready to accommodate, adjust and adapt as the different tasks develop and are implemented.</p>
                           <p>This is also evident in the customization of the trainings for different audiences and cultural contexts, the development of new assessment tools for different organizations and processes, and the periodic interactions with beneficiaries, especially the Champions for Change.</p>
                           <p>Africa Lead actively seeks to learn, whether through feedback from participants or stakeholders, or among implementing partners and Africa Lead team members. The goal of the learning is two-fold: first, to improve results and outcomes of the project itself, and second, to have evidence on the usefulness of different approaches that can be considered by other capacity building projects.</p>

                              First, let me say, the certificates they presented to us. They gave me a glass figurine with &ldquo;Champion&rdquo; written on it. I put it on my table in the office. And it says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a Champion.&rdquo;&nbsp; Am I a Champion?&nbsp; What makes me a Champion? &nbsp;How can I exhibit that I am a Champion?&nbsp; These are things that make me not forget.

                           </blockquote>
                           <p>The Module One training has been found to be &ldquo;transformative&rdquo; by Champions who have experienced it. Much of this strong impact is attributable to the African regional trainers who have been able to elicit strong emotions from the participants. Another key component to the Africa-rooted roll out of the Module One training is the designing of the material that has become synonymous with the &ldquo;Champions brand&rdquo;. These include Champion banners for photos, awards and the training manual.</p>
                           <p>The participants themselves have developed the identity of &ldquo;Champion&rdquo;. This is a term that emerged during the training and has stuck after it as well. Participants use it to identify themselves with other individuals who have also participated in the training as in &ldquo;I am Champion X&rdquo;. &ldquo;Are you a Champion?&rdquo;</p>
                           <p>This designation has become the mark of those who had been involved in Africa Lead&rsquo;s trainings and became part of the &ldquo;Champion&rdquo; network. To help facilitate this network, Africa Lead has a Facebook page for Champions to share and communicate with each other; other Champion cohorts have also set up their own local Facebook sites. Africa Lead also convenes Champions for Change Networks and Super Champions Meetings as a venue to further strengthen networks.</p>
                           <p>An end of project Lessons Learned Workshop was held in June 2013 <span class="infotip" data="At the time that this workshop was held the project was slated to close in September, three months from the workshop.">&loz;</span> to reflect on the work of Africa Lead to date. Participants included CAADP representatives, Champions for Change trained by Africa Lead, key USAID personnel, and members of the Africa Lead team. All shared their experiences and thoughts on the impact Africa Lead.</p>
                           <p>The way some Champions refer to the experience and what they have gained from the training is instructive.</p>

                           <p>Some use language of religious conversion to refer to how deeply they have been changed by the training, referring to the Champions for Change training as having &ldquo;created a religion; a community of &lsquo;believers.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
                           <p>Others mention that it does not matter whether someone took the training in Zimbabwe or Tanzania, all the Champions &ldquo;are talking the same language and are always at home with each other.&rdquo; No matter where or when they took the training the &ldquo;Champions&rdquo; continue to relate to each other, having a similar mindset toward the food security challenge.</p>
                           <p>The Champions talk about having a certain &ldquo;fire in their belly,&rdquo; a new sense of urgency to work together toward food security. One participant explained it as, &ldquo;the training changed me from a human &lsquo;being&rsquo; to a human &lsquo;doing.&rsquo;</p>

                           <p>Impact attributed to the Africa Lead experience by participants ranges from personal empowerment to firm business contracts, to advances in the policy realm.</p>
                           <p>These samples are testament of the momentum that started with Module One and continued through Module Two trainings of Champions into a constellation of added-value exchanges, networking and collaboration including the customized trainings and outreach to non-state actors.</p>

                           <p>Two main activities have been designed to systematically capture and consider the lessons learned. The first activity is the qualitative Lessons Learned research. In July and August 2012, two Africa Lead researchers conducted over 100 interviews with training beneficiaries in ten countries across the continent.&nbsp; The study documents the views of training beneficiaries on what has worked well and what can be improved upon with respect primarily to the Champions for Change training.</p>

                           <p>The interviewees provide insight into how they perceive their own capacity building needs for agriculture and food security, giving practical suggestions on how to ensure CAADP plays a meaningful role guiding agriculture development within their national and regional contexts.</p>
                           <p>The second systematic effort to draw lessons from the project and its elements is the Africa Lead Lessons Learned Conference (<em>Lessons Learned Workshop: Sustaining The Momentum - Champions Transforming Institutions</em>) that was held in Kenya on June 11 &amp;12, 2013. This workshop brought together USAID, CAADP representatives, the Africa Lead team and many partners, Champions and other beneficiaries of the project to seek to capture the essence of what Africa Lead has accomplished and what can be learned from these successes and challenges.</p>
                           <p>Over the two day workshop participants shared facts and figures as well as personal testimonials of their experiences, creating a powerful picture of how the Africa Lead project affected lives, communities and institutions. The workshop helped establish a core set of lessons which then flowed into recommended actions that will build in Africa Lead, sustain the momentum, and achieve the critical mass of Champions and higher performing organizations needed for Africa&rsquo;s agricultural transformation.</p>
                           <p>The main lessons distilled largely from the workshop are classified into two types of lessons: (1) Programmatic, and (2) Operational.</p>
                           <p>Africa Lead hopes that these lessons will be valuable for others implementing capacity building programs aimed at expediting improvements in agricultural productivity and food security in Africa.</p>
                           <strong>Programmatic Lessons:</strong>
                           <p>There have been many lessons learned from Africa Lead, and the greatest challenge is not identifying those lessons but identifying which are the most pertinent ones for future capacity building initiatives.</p>

                              <li><strong>Leadership training matters. </strong>Often overlooked, leadership training is critically important and a missing element of the capacity building and progress in agriculture and food security. Transforming agriculture is not simply a technical matter but is requires stronger, more results-oriented institutions led by innovative, team-oriented, results-focused, transformative leaders. Leadership helps put the various elements of food security into a holistic perspective, seeing the systems that all need to work together to achieve greater agricultural productivity, better nutrition and improved food security. Participants have a stronger work ethic, more of a sense of purpose and drive to work hard. The project is designed based on this premise, but at times the importance of leadership and change management training has been questioned as a priority vis &agrave; vis technical training. The consensus from the Lessons Learned workshop is a resounding agreement that leadership training is critically important for success in agriculture policy and programming.</li>

Champions will largely drive transformational change through their institutions or community involvement. To help Champions for Change for Food Security deepen and widen their networks of like-minded agriculture professionals it will be useful to support cascade trainings by the Champions most interested and driven to provide onward training.<br />

                                 Providing minimal support to help create and sustain networks of Champions that will allow them to continue to dialogue and exchange ideas can help foster innovation.

This allows for a wider reach and should be a supported activity. Cascade training can be supported with ready-to-use training material as well as having general access to training materials.&nbsp; Africa Lead is currently finalizing its E-Learning workshop tool that will be available for free online. There is a clear consensus among Champions that with small amounts of support they can expand the reach of the Champions training and thereby broaden the number of people who not only understand the CAADP principles, approach and goals, but also have changed mindsets about the role they can play in ensuring food security.</li>

                              <li><strong>It is important to target decision makers</strong>. Africa Lead has learned how important it is to include top level leadership &ndash; parliament, ministry and private sector executives in the trainings, engaging them in the process that they influence. The leadership training initially targeted leaders who did not necessarily hold high office -- mid-level civil servants, private sector and civil society professionals with varying levels of seniority in their own organizations. In early leadership training participants often voiced the desire to extend the training &ldquo;to our bosses&rdquo;. This demonstrates both the value attributed to the training by the participants and their view that their supervisors will benefit from similar training. Ultimately, Africa Lead has been able to provide an abbreviated version of the five day leadership training to top level decision makers. Targeting decision makers supports buy-in as well as creating avenues for better communication about policy.</li>
                              <li><strong>Leadership training with a focus is more powerful</strong><strong>.</strong> A large part of the success of the leadership training, according to interviews with Champions for Change, is attributable to the purpose for which the leadership training was provided, and the clear articulation of the proposition, &ldquo;Leadership training &hellip;for Food Security.&rdquo; Participants imagine, and are encouraged during the training to do so, applying their newly gained leadership and change management skills to play a part in bringing about real changes in food security.&nbsp; Participants are helped to expand their horizons toward a shared goal that is larger than each participant&rsquo;s own limited interests. The power of the training derives from its specificity and its near direct applicability (participants develop action plans); it is not leadership training in the abstract.</li>
                              <li><strong>Contextualized training increases impact</strong>. One of the key parts of the success of the training is its use of African regional trainers who are able to adapt the curriculum to engage the hearts and minds of the participants in an African context. This has been indispensable to the success of the trainings. The African trainers personalize the curriculum to include the &ldquo;Little Girl&rdquo; and the &ldquo;African Pot&rdquo; exercises in the training that receive an overwhelmingly positive response. &nbsp;Pictures and facts have been tweaked specifically to fit the context of individual countries.<br />

                              </li>
                           </ul>
                           <strong>In addition to the modifications made to contextualize the curriculum, other successful elements of the training are:</strong>
                           <ul>
                              <li>Using adult learning methods.</li>
                              <li>Using and relating to people&rsquo;s emotions &ndash; making the issue personal.
                              <li>Making participants feel special and that someone is investing in them.</li>
                              <li>Having quality and enthusiastic trainers.</li>
                              <li>Creating Personal Strategic Plans &ndash; each person goes home with plan</li>
                           </ul>
                           <h3>Lessons Learned from Conducting Assessments:</h3>
                           <p><img src="img/lessons_training.png" id="lessons_training" class="image_center" style="height:250px" /></p>
                           <ul>
                              <li><strong>Get buy-in from stakeholders.</strong> This is a lesson from the assessments conducted by Africa Lead. Assessments require deep engagement and buy-in from all stakeholders, funders and object of assessment alike. Ownership by the subject institution of the assessment process is pivotally important and increases the possibility that the findings will be implemented. This means building commitment and involvement with the organizations through the process, involving top management of the institution in initial planning and having the assessment be participatory or a facilitated self-assessments methodology to be a learning exercise.</li>
                              <li><strong>Make recommended actions feasible</strong>. It is important to make sure organizations can implement the recommendations both financially and structurally. To achieve this it is important to connect process to existing policy processes; include &lsquo;low hanging fruit&rsquo; to increase organizations' performance without external assistance and validate and review the findings with the institutions.</li>
                              <li><strong>Follow up assessments with capacity building programs.</strong> For credibility it is important that donor projects that conduct assessments are also prepared to provide capacity building support where gaps have been identified. When assessments are not followed by capacity building in a relatively short period, the subject institutions are likely to become averse to participating freely in capacity needs assessments. Instances like the Africa Lead experience with CORAF and CILSS, in which the West Africa Mission commissioned institutional capacity needs assessments and capacity building support, are especially fruitful partnerships.&nbsp;</li>
                           </ul>
                           <h3>Operational/Administration Lessons</h3>
                           <ul>
                              <li><strong>Budget Planning. </strong>Some of the challenges that Africa Lead faced during the past three years are the complex budgets due to the multiple buy-ins. Although this is the nature of the project and this mechanism allows the Missions to buy-in, it also has to be recognized that the complexity of managing multiple budgets with limited scopes of work requires a great deal of effort to manage and maintain the budgets, particularly when it comes to projections.</li>
                              <li><strong>Approval process and clearance process. </strong>Given the pattern of new activities consistently starting and stopping throughout the project as different Missions make requests it is essential to have quick turnaround and approvals from USAID to be able to complete tasks that the Missions request.</li>
                              <li><strong>Complexity of project. </strong>Africa Lead is a continent-wide project with multiple implementers, Missions, and beneficiaries. There are many moving parts to the project which creates challenges.</li>
                              <li><strong>Consistent point of contact in mission. </strong>Establishing specific people to work with at the Missions allows for consistent communication and planning.</li>
                              <li><strong>Buy-in. </strong>Mission buy-in is essential to the success and continuation of Africa Lead. This made it very important to communicate what the project does and how and why the Mission benefits from buying-in.</li>
                              <li><strong>Regional Differences. </strong>Because of the scope of the project it is necessary to understand the differences among countries, regions and cultures. This applies to adjusting the training, planning logistics, understanding the different systems and context, including different needs and requests from Missions.</li>
                              <li><strong>Financial Flexibility</strong>.&nbsp; A flexible grant program is important for funding various activities.&nbsp; In order to be responsive to opportunities related to the work, mechanisms that allow grant funding are an efficient way to reinforce program investments.<br />
                                 &nbsp;
                              </li>
                              <li><strong>Reporting</strong>.&nbsp; A structured reporting schedule is more effective than reporting on demand.&nbsp; A program such as Africa Lead with activities both planned in advance and delivered on a rapid response basis can better track and integrate developments on a regular reporting schedule.&nbsp;</li>
                           </ul>
                           <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                           <blockquote>
                              In order to make progress we can&rsquo;t stay where we are, we have to be in motion. Looking at issues as though you are looking through a kaleidoscope, it never stays the same.&nbsp; So you have to have to act to take advantage of each situation, to get the best out of it, to make sure the opportunity you have on hand is put to the utmost use.

                           <p>Africa Lead is a capacity building program that operates across three Sub-Saharan Africa&nbsp;regions working across public, civil society, university and private sector institutions. The program seeks to establish and maintain a critical mass of food security &ldquo;Champions&rdquo; who can drive agriculture-led development by leading and implementing the Regional and National Agriculture Investment Plans within the CAADP framework.</p>
                           <p>Africa Lead also conducts institutional capacity assessments, sponsors agriculture interns and produces a database of food security and agriculture related online trainings, while functioning as a support mechanism for the USAID Missions by providing logistical support for conferences, trainings and meetings.</p>
                           <p>Africa Lead represents an approach to advancing food security on the continent through a powerful yet simple premise: empower a cadre of agricultural actors with the skills to lead others.&nbsp; This fundamental tenant of change has taken on a life of its own with the self-identified Champions of Africa Lead. To them, leadership is movement.&nbsp; It may reside as a sense of purpose and power in individuals, but its expression is as a collective force.&nbsp; It takes strong institutions, coordination among agencies, continuous learning and sharing.</p>
                           <p>Perhaps the enduring lesson of Africa Lead is this participatory quality.&nbsp; As one Champion has noted: &ldquo;Change is not always welcome&hellip;This is Africa.&rdquo; Yet, Africa Lead has empowered thousands of Africans to prove otherwise about their continent.&nbsp; Thinking outside the box is producing action that is transforming the way change itself is understood, accepted and even embraced in terms of making communities, countries and the region more food secure.</p>

After the avalanche, it took us a week to climb out. Now, I don't know exactly when we turned on each other, but I know that seven of us survived the slide... and only five made it out. Now we took an oath, that I'm breaking now. We said we'd say it was the snow that killed the other two, but it wasn't. Nature is lethal but it doesn't hold a candle to man. </p>

                              Introduction and Background
                           </h1>
                           <p>This report describes findings from over 100 qualitative key informant interviews with mid- and senior-level professionals from ten sub-Saharan Africa countries who participated in leadership training for agriculture and food security provided by USAID&rsquo;s Africa Leadership Training and Capacity Building Program (Africa Lead.)&nbsp; The interviews were conducted July and August 2012 as part of knowledge management to document lessons learned from Africa Lead in relation to Task One Champions for Change leadership and management capacity building courses. The interviews contain feedback on <strong><em>lessons learned</em></strong> and <strong><em>best practices</em></strong> from training beneficiaries, referred to herein as Champions, on an important capacity building methodology for agriculture piloted by Africa Lead. They also give insight into how Africans perceive their own capacity building needs for agriculture and food security, and contain practical suggestions from these Champions for Change practitioners on how to ensure CAADP plays a meaningful role guiding agriculture development within their national and regional contexts.</p>
                           <strong>The Africa Lead Program</strong>
                           <p>Africa Lead is USAID&rsquo;s main capacity building program for agriculture in sub-Saharan Africa. The program supports capacity building needs of the U.S. Government&rsquo;s Feed the Future Initiative, which aligns U.S. Government development assistance with African-owned agriculture development plans, which are in turn aligned with the African Union&rsquo;s Comprehensive African Agricultural Development Program (CAADP.)&nbsp; Africa Lead was initially a two-year task order under the RAISE Plus Indefinite Quantity Contract (IQC) mechanism, designed to run from September 20, 2010 to September 30, 2012, with a budget ceiling of $21,332,381. As of a September 30, 2012 contract modification, the program was extended through September 2013 and the ceiling was raised to $26,182,381. Africa Lead is being implemented by RAISE Plus IQC holder, DAI, supported by Management Systems International (MSI), Winrock International, Training Resources Group (TRG), ECI Africa Consulting (pty) Ltd., and Michigan State University. Africa Lead was implemented through three regional offices: Accra, Ghana; Nairobi, Kenya; and Pretoria, South Africa from the beginning of the program until July 31, 2012 when the Pretoria office closed. Program implementation for Southern Africa was then taken over by the East Africa Office.</p>
                           <p>Africa Lead is a highly flexible mechanism that provides a menu of capacity building options to the USAID East and West Africa Regional Missions and to local Missions in all 12 African Feed the Future (FTF) focus countries, as well as FTF aligned countries. Africa Lead provides leadership and management training, institutional capacity assessments, logistical support for training workshops and meetings, and innovative short courses and internship/twinning arrangements prioritized in consultation with Missions and partner countries and institutions, and a database of trainings offered on the continent that can be matched to local leadership and capacity building needs. The flexibility of Africa Lead as a mechanism means that the same set of tools can be used for institutional capacity assessments and for capacity building needs in a wide range of different contexts and environments, and can be used at the continental, regional, national or sub-national levels. By providing USAID Missions with flexible capacity building options it strives to increase participation of African leaders and institutions engaged in the CAADP process (SO1) and to strengthen key leaders technical and managerial skills and knowledge of agriculture systems and food security (SO2).</p>
                           <p>Africa Lead&rsquo;s activities fall into four Tasks: leadership and management training falls under Task One; logistical support for training workshops and meetings, and innovative short courses and internship/twinning arrangements fall under Task Two; institutional capacity assessments fall under Task Three; and developing a database of trainings offered on the continent falls under Task Four.</p>
                           <strong>Background on Task One</strong>
                           <p>The best practices/lessons learned (BP/LL) research described in this report focuses on Africa Lead&rsquo;s Task One: provision of leadership and management training to African food security leaders through two capacity building courses designed and delivered. Two key outcomes which USAID hopes to achieve from Task One training include establishing a strong cadre of leaders to spearhead implementation of the CAADP framework and National Agriculture Investment Plans (NAIPs) at the national level, and to establish individual action plans which trainees will follow to advance inclusive, pro-poor agriculture growth and food security agendas in the context of their roles, networks and institutions at home.</p>
                           <p>As of December 31, 2012, Task One remained one of Africa Lead&rsquo;s biggest service areas with 1,616 mid- and senior-level professionals and politicians trained in leadership skills and approaches and in CAADP principles and processes. Graduates of the trainings, who call themselves CAADP Champions for Change or simply Champions for Food Security, are English and French speakers from 29 sub-Saharan countries. They work across a broad range of sectors: 34% from NGO&rsquo;s and civil society institutions, 36% from the public sector, 15% from the private sector, and 14% from university or research institutions. Although many Champions have college or post-graduate degrees and work in formal sector jobs, others have come to occupy important roles in their sub-national or national food systems without much formal education. It is noteworthy that early in the process of developing the leadership training, the term &ldquo;leader&rdquo; was jettisoned in favor of &ldquo;Champion&rdquo; given the negative connotations that the former is considered to have in Africa.</p>
                           <p>When the Africa Lead program began in 2010 the Bureau of Food Security asked Regional and local Missions and their African counterparts to identify mid-level professionals working in agriculture and food security to participate in a training program to develop leadership skills and knowledge relevant to moving the CAADP process forward at the national level. The objective in 2010 was to generate a pool of skilled food security Champions in each country who were informed about and committed to CAADP, and motivated to engage with their national governments around CAADP. The first wave of trainings, in a 5-day residential course called Module One, was held in Nairobi, Accra and Pretoria, where the Africa Lead regional offices were located. They drew participants from multiple countries and contained sessions focused on leadership skills for food security and CAADP. The exception was Uganda, where Module One trainings were held for Ugandans only. A sample agenda for the standard Module One program is provided below:</p>

                           <p>&nbsp;</p>
                           <p>Module One was followed by a second wave of 4-day residential trainings in a course called Module Two. Although there is some overlap in content between them, Module Two is more focused on management skills needed to implement and accelerate initiatives to transform agriculture and achieve food security at sub-national, national or regional levels. Module One is more focused on nurturing leaders who are motivated and able to spearhead policy change processes and agriculture transformation in their countries. Unlike Module One, most Module Two trainings are held in the country of the local USAID Mission paying for the training and only include participants from a single country, single set of organizations or single institution, depending on the objective of the training. The exception to this is Module Two trainings paid for by the Regional Missions which target staff from regional institutions with roles in CAADP&rsquo;s four pillars or those key to facilitating regional economic integration. A sample agenda for the standard Module Two program is provided below:</p>

                           <p>&nbsp;</p>
                           <p>Most Module One trainings that have been provided by Africa Lead in East, Southern and West Africa occurred between January and July 2011. In September 2011 a simplified three-day Non-State Actor (NSA) Dialogue Platform training on CAADP and methods for engaging governments and stakeholders in policy dialogues was held for non-state actors (community-based, academic, media, private sector organizations) in several Africa Lead countries in East, Southern and West Africa. Module Two trainings began in Tanzania in the summer of 2011 and in Ghana and Liberia in March/April of 2012. Since that time, East and West African Regional and local Missions have continued to submit buy-in orders for Africa Lead training workshops based on customized blends of the original Module One curriculum and the Module Two curriculum. Examples of customized trainings include adaptations of the Module One leadership training for high level Parliamentarians in Uganda and Government-to-Government Policy Dialogues developed to facilitate collaboration and coordination on policy formation and planning among ministries in Tanzania. The adaptability of Africa Lead&rsquo;s training curricula to cater to different audiences or training objectives depending on the strategic interests of the Mission buying in constitutes an important level of flexibility that allows Africa Lead to address widely different contexts at sub-national, national and regional levels with a relatively simple set of capacity building tools.</p>
                           <strong>Capacity building for CAADP at 10 years</strong>
                           <p>In 2003, in Maputo, Mozambique, African Leaders endorsed CAADP as the action plan for putting agriculture back on Africa&rsquo;s development agenda. As CAADP approaches its 10th anniversary, enormous progress has been made by the African Union and NEPAD (New Partnership for Africa&rsquo;s Development) establishing CAADP values and principles, an integrated four-pillar framework and roadmap to guide agriculture investment across the continent. As of March 2013, 30 countries have signed CAADP compacts and 22 have established peer-reviewed National Agriculture Investment Plans (NAIPs) with another 8 in progress. Now the challenge facing CAADP is to transform itself from a continental policy framework into tangible regional and country-level actions to implement regional integration and country level NAIPs, guided by the CAADP framework and core CAADP values and principles.</p>
                           <p>The 2008 NEPAD CAADP Country Implementation Guide provides a roadmap for the formation CAADP country teams to spearhead implementation of country level NAIPs. When the Africa Lead program began in October 2010, very few people in Africa knew about CAADP, making it difficult to build the country-level institutional architecture that the AU and NEPAD envisioned to carry forward with implementation of NAIPs. Africa Lead Task One trainings were designed to support CAADP&rsquo;s capacity building agenda by addressing this gap. In addition to providing technical content on CAADP and food security frameworks, Africa Lead also focuses on leadership and management skills needed to promote values and principles that are core to the CAADP framework. As stated by NEPAD (NEPAD 2008) CAADP principles, values and goals include:</p>
                           <p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Building partnerships and alliances across ministries and sectors to include farmers, agribusiness and civil society is fundamental to the CAADP agenda, both as a core component and in acknowledging that agriculture is a crosscutting sector. The [CAADP] goal is to facilitate alignment of development efforts, raise participation of farmer organizations, the private sector, and other stakeholders in the policymaking process, and enable greater ease of access to technical expertise by players at all levels of the food system.</p>
                           <p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dialogue, transparency, peer review and mutual accountability among stakeholders going down to the local level, in order to encourage collective responsibility and inclusive participation in policy development.</p>
                           <p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Practicing results-oriented management based on benchmarking, mutual evidence-based learning through monitoring and evaluation, and harmonization of development efforts.</p>
                           <p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exploitation of regional complementarities and cooperation to boost growth by addressing common mutual needs and regional comparative advantage. (NEPAD, 2008).</p>
                           <p>A key question for CAADP&rsquo;s capacity building agenda going foreword is to identify the kinds of capacity building methodologies, strategies and targets needed to transform CAADP&rsquo;s values and principles into meaningful action at the regional and country level. What will it take to generate meaningful buy-in to CAADP values of inclusiveness, transparency, and accountability by a broad base of Africans?&nbsp; What will it take to shift knowledge, values and behaviors of coalitions or interest groups that are vested in the current status quo institutional and policy arrangements governing agriculture in their countries?</p>
                           <p>&ldquo;Although growth rate and budget share are the two targets most often associated with CAADP, the value addition to countries from adoption of the framework is expected to come from absorbing its values and principles. According to NEPAD (2008) the &lsquo;litmus test for success of the CAADP framework and agenda will be its influence on how development and economic investment plans are developed and implemented.&rsquo; &nbsp;One of the key objectives will be to improve the quality of planning and investments, with quality underpinned by the extent of consultation in their development. Additionally, NEPAD (2008) notes that an important aspect of CAADP&rsquo;s value added in terms of increasing the value of agriculture investment programs will come from fundamental institutional and policy changes in the implementation mechanisms. This emphasis on implementation was absent in earlier documents on CAADP.&rdquo; (IFPRI 2010).</p>
                           <strong>Training methodology for Africa Lead Task One</strong>
                           <p>Africa Lead Task One training workshops integrate technical content on CAADP and integrated food security frameworks with content on leadership skills, change management and managing for results. In Module One, practical tools for leadership and change management are based on the &ldquo;Modeling the Way&rdquo; methodology of Jim Kouzes and Barry Posner for leadership and John Kotter&rsquo;s world-renowned 8-step process for managing change. The &ldquo;Modeling the Way&rdquo; methodology emphasizes that leadership is not about personality but about behaviors. Five behaviors that Kouzes and Posner identify that exemplify great leadership are depicted below:</p>
                           <p><img src="img/energizing_5_behaviors.png" id="energizing_5_behaviors" class="image_right" style="height:250px;" /></p>
                           <p><img src="img/energizing_eight_steps.png" id="energizing_eight_steps" class="image_left" style="height:250px;" /><br />
                              John Kotter, in his eight-step process for leading change, emphasizes that change initiatives are very emotional processes and that the biggest challenge that leaders will face when leading change initiatives will be changing the behavior of people. The eight steps on his process for leading change are depicted below:
                           </p>
                           <p>&nbsp;</p>
                           <p>&nbsp;</p>
                           <p>Although John Kotter&rsquo;s model for leading change and the Kouzes and Posner model for leadership behaviors are primary sources of content, workshop curricula also include a wealth of psychological tools and games designed to jolt participants out of habitual ways of seeing and perceiving the world and their roles in it. Examples include &ldquo;The Roadblock,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Animal Game&rdquo; and &ldquo;Thinking Outside the Box.&rdquo;</p>
                           <p>
                              In Module Two, the primary focus is on managing for results and a primary methodology is the Rapid Result&rsquo;s Institute&rsquo;s Rapid Results Approach (RRA). The RRA is a simple but highly choreographed process whereby organizations (or operational units within organizations) develop rapid results initiatives (RRI) focused on achieving an ambitious goal in 60 to 120 days. The structure of the initiative is carried out in three acts &ndash; pre-launch, launch and implementation. Each act is designed to neutralize common systemic barriers to performance. The provision of coaching support during the implementation phase is an important part of the RRA concept. The three unique elements of a rapid results initiative are depicted in the visual

                           <p><img src="img/energizing_three_unique.png" id="energizing_three_unique" class="image_center" style="height:250px;" /><br /></p>
                           <p>&nbsp;</p>
                           <p>Task One&rsquo;s highly participatory pedagogy incorporates current understanding of best practices for adult learning, highlighting ways that mature adult learners differ from younger learners. Adults have strong egos and extensive depth of experience to share. They also have a variety of learning styles, including visual, auditory and kinesthetic. Each workshop session includes elements catering to each learning style with breakouts for small groups to interact, share and relate content to their own life experience. Great care was taken in both East and West Africa on selection of facilitators for the workshops. Only those sensitive and responsive to body language and affect of participants, who asked open-ended questions to bring out and engage participants, and who understood the material on a technical level were hired. Africa Lead staff training coordinators, who also attended trainings, provided ongoing feedback to the facilitators, so within a short time they were exceptionally skilled in establishing a warm safe environment and encouraging participation. Most Module One workshops were residential and participants were actively encouraged to engage with one another and to expand their professional networks.</p>
                           <p>Africa Lead staff training coordinators and facilitators were all Africans from the regions where workshops were being held. During the training-of-trainer sessions prior to the launch of the first workshops in January 2010, they made a seminal decision to modify the workshop modules by incorporating uniquely African elements. In order to help workshop participants experience a direct, personal and emotional link to the concept of food insecurity, they incorporated an image of a broken clay grain pot as a major visual motif throughout the five-day training. &ldquo;The Broken Pot&rdquo; became a potent symbol freighted with layers of meaning, much in the way religious symbols functions. It focused participants&rsquo; minds and opened their hearts to the core tragedy of Africans unable to feed themselves. This in turn became the jumping off point for discussions on causes of the failure and how to change the situation.</p>
                           <p>Conversely, the &ldquo;unbroken&rdquo; African pot became a symbol of food security success. During course deliveries, participants or small groups who made significant contributions to the learning process &ndash; for example, by sharing a particularly insightful idea or providing a helpful summary &ndash; were invited to come before the group to &ldquo;feed&rdquo; the unbroken African pot with a handful of seeds or grain.</p>
                           <p>In addition to the broken pot, the African trainers incorporated the story of a little girl who suffers from malnutrition, using a photographic image. Like the broken pot, the little girl was a non-conceptual entry point that broke down participants&rsquo; &ldquo;professional&rdquo; role identities and got them relating on a personal and intimate level, by really thinking through the effects that poverty, nutrition, gender and climate change would have on her story. The little girl opened participants to their own stories and histories and to the reality of food insecurity in their countries.</p>
                           <p>In addition to symbols and stories that opened participants&rsquo; hearts to the tragedy and urgency of food insecurity and hunger in their countries, the workshop incorporated <em>aspirational</em> stories that provided living examples of extraordinary impacts individuals can make. Several Champions mentioned these aspirational models as important to their transformation into Champions, challenging themselves with the thought that if that person can do it, so can I.</p>
                           <p>The third crucial innovation was the decision to conduct trainings using African vernacular English instead of &ldquo;university English&rdquo; and to lace discussions of technical content with African proverbs and stories to illustrate and bring home points.</p>
                           <strong>Transformative training: an innovation for African agriculture</strong>
                           <p>Many people involved with Africa Lead, including the Deputy Chiefs of Party (DCOPs), staff training coordinators and workshop facilitators described the Task One workshops as transformative. The source and definition of Africa Lead&rsquo;s transformative pedagogy was provided in an interview with Dr. John Azu, staff training coordinator for West Africa.</p>
                           <p>&ldquo;Right at the onset, the designers of the program decided to go with transformational change. That underpinned the design of the training itself. For transformational change, they referred us to Kotter&rsquo;s work, which simply stated says you can teach people all the principles and practices for creating and managing change. However, he added one component which brought about that transformational power, and that is the feeling part of it, not the intellectual part. We can read about change management as intellectual discourses, but nothing happens, because feeling is what generates the compassion, the desire to change. Emotion brings life, action and power to the thought that is conveyed. When you mix emotions with the thoughts you are conveying, it suddenly becomes part of the person. That&rsquo;s when transformation occurs. Those who went through this training and who understood it, got transformed within themselves. It doesn&rsquo;t wear out, how can it?&nbsp; It becomes part of your thinking, part of the working equipment of your mind.&rdquo;&nbsp; (Dr. John Azu)</p>
                           <p>The transformative impact of the trainings described by Dr. Azu was amply corroborated by testimony from the Lessons Learned research. During the research, we probed whether this is an innovation in pedagogy for African agriculture. The transformative impact of the workshops does appear to be an innovation that results from a combination of the &ldquo;Africanized&rdquo; presentation, and use of symbols, games and stories to generate a direct emotional connection to and sense of urgency about the issue of food insecurity in workshop participants.</p>
                           <p>The facilitators for East Africa all have significant depth of experience facilitating training workshops in a wide variety of contexts. In a key informant interview with them we generated a rough classification of training workshops based on their combined years of practice. All workshops contain &ldquo;technical&rdquo; content, from obviously technical to less obviously technical subjects, such as human resource management. Out of all trainings they had participated in, in roughly 80% the content was delivered didactically and in 20% the content was delivered using participatory methodologies. But even the participatory workshops maintained a distance between the feelings of the participants and the technical material being presented.</p>
                           <p>Africa Lead workshops were the first time these facilitators consciously strove, as one of them put it, &ldquo;to build and work with the emotional energies of the participants&rdquo; as an essential part of the methodology. The idea to integrate emotional urgency into the methodology comes from the first of Kotter&rsquo;s 8-step change management process, which is to create a sense of personal urgency and responsibility about the topic that is the focus of change. The need to engage people emotionally in order to engender urgency for change in the context of African food security was eloquently expressed by a Tanzanian Champion:</p>
                           <p>&ldquo;Leadership training that addresses peoples&rsquo; heart is important. People have to be touched. You have to wake up those sleeping emotions. The challenge is to reach deep into the heart to give us a bit of a shock. So that we realize that no matter how small we are, we do have an important role, and if we don&rsquo;t perform it, the system fails.&rdquo; &nbsp;(Tanzania R13 advisor to high political office)</p>
                           <p>The few Champions in the Lessons Learned sample who had been on <strong><em>internships</em></strong>&nbsp; (Task Two) were very appreciative of the opportunity to further build their professional skills. In Tanzania and Uganda, the ability to offer internships or other career enhancing opportunities for practical training, on fairly short notice, was something both Missions valued highly about the Africa Lead program. USAID points of contact interviewed for the Lessons Learned research said that this flexibility allows them to take advantage of unanticipated opportunities to build the skills of food system leaders in their countries. Also, because public sector leaders value the internships, the Missions&rsquo; capacity to offer them helps improve the receptivity of government leaders to other aspects of Africa Lead.</p>
                           <p>Under Task Three, Africa Lead conducts institutional mapping and assessments as a diagnostic to help Missions decide where to target investments in capacity building and what kind of capacity building modality to use. Missions have used Task Three for institutional mapping and assessments followed by customized Module Two trainings for a specific organization based on the assessment. While this is a valid approach, the Lessons Learned research suggests that <em>also </em>targeting leaders of these organizations for Module One leadership training will increase the sustainability and impact of customized Module Two management trainings for mid-level staff.</p>
                           <strong>Justification for a qualitative Lessons Learned discovery process</strong>
                           <p>As Africa Lead moved into its second year USAID Africa/Sustainable Development saw the need to document lessons learned on best practices in relation to the learning and capacity building modalities piloted by Task One in order to inform future USAID programs. Although leadership training has long been used by organizations to improve efficacy or gain an innovative edge, its application as a capacity building tool for mid- and senior-level agriculture professionals in Africa is relatively new. Prior to Africa Lead, the two best-known examples were the African Women Leaders in Agriculture and Environment and the African Women in Agriculture Research and Development, both &ldquo;Cadillac&rdquo; programs with high costs per beneficiary.</p>
                           <p>Applying relatively low cost short course leadership trainings across a whole continental sector, with the goal of accelerating country level implementation of CAADP principles and NAIPs is an innovation piloted by the Africa Lead program. If effective in building awareness of CAADP, energizing new leadership for food security, and building commitment to CAADP values and principles and skills to implement actions based on them, the leadership methodology piloted by Africa Lead could be an important addition to the capacity building tool box for agriculture in Africa, irrespective of whether or not CAADP itself is the strategic focus of trainings.</p>
                           <p>Africa Lead established a results framework and project monitoring plan which uses pre- and post-training workshop surveys, six-month post-training surveys administered via Internet, and success stories to monitor impacts on Champions&rsquo; knowledge, individual behavior and wider environments as a result of their participation in Task One training workshops. However, in order to document lessons learned and best practices for USAID Missions going forward, a more in-depth discovery process with Champions and other stakeholders was necessary.</p>
                           <p>The Lessons Learned research contributes to the evidence base on capacity building for African agriculture by looking at the efficacy of transformative leadership and management training for instilling CAADP values and principles in mid- and senior-level Africans. What do the Champions who took the trainings have to say about the efficacy and importance of this approach for their own lives, organizations and the wider &ldquo;institutional ecologies&rdquo; in which they operate?&nbsp; What are their further observations on the relevance of CAADP to food systems transformation in their own national contexts?&nbsp; Of primary concern was to understand Champions&rsquo; perceptions on the usefulness and importance of Africa Lead&rsquo;s Task One methodology, as well as best practices. Another concern was to get feedback from Champions on promising strategies to support their continuing evolution as food security Champions, as well as promising strategies to accelerate transition to new attitudes and behaviors aligned with CAADP values throughout key agriculture and food security networks in their countries.</p>
                           <strong>Theory of change and non-technical barriers to food systems transformation</strong>
                           <p>The theory of change behind Africa Lead Task One leadership and management training is that:</p>
                           <p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5-day transformative leadership and 4-day management training courses change knowledge, attitudes, motivation and behavior of individual participants</p>
                           <p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Individuals with changed knowledge, attitudes, motivation and behavior become change agents within their organizations and networks</p>
                           <p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As individuals, organizations and networks change, behaviors in wider inter-personal and institutional networks that influence key food system processes also begin to change.</p>
                           <p>The assumption underlying the theory of change is that individual level &ldquo;factors&rdquo; related to knowledge gaps, attitudes, motivation and behavior influence ways in which wider systems function, for better or worse. Discussions of such &ldquo;non-technical factors&rdquo; came up repeatedly in key informant interviews with respondents as a major motif of the Lessons Learned discovery process, referred to by Champions as &ldquo;mind-sets&rdquo; that stand in the way of progress. Here we use <em>&ldquo;non-technical barriers to food systems transformation&rdquo;</em> to refer to such factors. For example: attitudes about authority suppress individual initiative and hence the capacity of the system as a whole to respond to and benefit from innovation that comes from within. In the words of a Ghanaian Champions:</p>
                           <p>&ldquo;That is the major problem we have in Africa. Our system is to respect authority. And the system is such that unless you reach a certain level, you cannot even talk, or if you talk, people will not listen. People have the intellect, they have ideas, but the system has made them shut up. It is holding us back, not only in Ghana, but in the whole of Africa. You can only build strong institutions when the individuals are empowered to come up with strong ideas. But our system is such that until you reach a certain level you cannot even talk. It kills initiative.&ldquo; (Ghana R1 national government)</p>
                           <p>In spite of being CAADP signatories and having peer reviewed NAIPs, many countries still have unfavorable policy environments for agriculture growth and food security and limited capacity to harness private sector financing to catalyze agriculture sector growth. They lack institutions or institutional processes capable of transparent, inclusive and accountable allocation of agriculture sector investments. Africa Lead Task One trainings built capacity and commitment of actors within the food system to mobilize across sectors to address these problems by building a new sense of moral urgency about food insecurity, new understanding that agriculture is a system that requires collaboration across all segments of society, improved policy literacy, new models of leadership, new attitudes about information sharing and collaboration, new models of evidence based advocacy to advance policy dialogue with governments, and perhaps most importantly, a new sense of empowerment and ownership that Africa&rsquo;s food problems can be solved by relatively ordinary Africans like themselves.</p>
                           <strong>Hypotheses guiding Lessons Learned discovery process</strong>
                           <p>Two hypotheses were explored in key informant interviews with Champions and also guided the content analysis stage that followed the fieldwork.</p>
                           <p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; H1:&nbsp; Non-technical factors related to individuals&rsquo; knowledge, attitudes, motivation and behavior function as barriers to food systems transformation.</p>
                           <p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strong:&nbsp; Leadership and management trainings change knowledge, attitudes, motivation and behaviors of individuals in ways that mitigate barriers to food systems transformation.</p>
                           <strong>Answering the &ldquo;So What?&rdquo; question</strong>
                           <p>The so-what question lies in two parts. First, are non-technical barriers important enough to invest in changing?&nbsp; If aligning the values of actors and stakeholders in African food systems with CAADP values is a priority, then transformative leadership and management training is worth investing in if it effectively aligns individual values with those of CAADP.</p>
                           <p>The second &ldquo;so what?&rdquo; question relates to scale needed for impact. How many CAADP Champions for Food Security need to be trained to have an impact on national and regional institutions and policy development processes?&nbsp; Although this question cannot be answered on the basis of a qualitative study such as this, several of the Champions who were interviewed made practical suggestions on how to target transformative leadership training to maximize the wider impacts in their countries. They also offered suggestions for post-training follow up activities to further amplify the impacts of the Champions who have been trained.</p>

                           <strong>Country studies and informants</strong>
                           <p>Interviews were conducted in Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda in July 2012, and Zambia and Zimbabwe, Ghana, Liberia, Nigeria and Senegal in August 2012. These countries were selected because their USAID Missions provided the preponderance of Task One beneficiaries. The final Lessons Learned sample included 48 Task One and NSA Champions from East, 17 from Southern and 51 from West Africa. Approximately two-thirds of the Lessons Learned sample were men; ~14% were younger than 35 years of age, ~ 61% were between 35 and 50 years of age, and ~ 25% were older than 50 years of age. Although most respondents were from national or sub-national organizations, six worked for regional organizations. In addition to Champions, five Africans familiar with the program who had not taken trainings were interviewed, as were Africa Lead&rsquo;s regional DCOPs, staff training coordinators and Task One trainers. USAID staff from the East Africa Regional Mission and seven country Missions (Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Ghana, Liberia, Nigeria and Senegal) were also interviewed. &nbsp;</p>
                           <strong>Sample selection and description</strong>
                           <p>The research sample was selected by Africa Lead&rsquo;s training coordinators and M&amp;E officers in East and West Africa. They used informant matrix mapping to set up a sampling frame for each of the ten country studies. The sampling frames clustered training beneficiaries by sector (<strong>government/public sector, NGO, research and universities, and private sector</strong>) and by type of training. Purposive selection of respondents was based on the sampling frames to ensure that the final sample included all the different categories of actors and perspectives of Africans involved with the program. Approximately 28% of respondents were from public sector agencies, 28% from NGOs, 16% were from research organizations and universities, and 28% were from the private sector. 87% of the respondents participated in Module One trainings, 22% participated in NSA workshops and 13% participated in Module Two trainings. Several of the respondents who attended NSA workshops or Module Two trainings also attended Module One, so were able to compare them. In addition to 116 Task One Champions, 4 interviews were conducted with individuals (from Ethiopia, Kenya, Uganda and Liberia respectively) who had gone on internships sponsored under Task Two.</p>
                           <p>In all ten country studies knowledge of CAADP before the training was inconsistent across respondents. For most of them Africa Lead was an important opportunity to learn about CAADP for the first time or to deepen superficial acquaintance with the framework. Less than a third of the respondents described themselves as somewhat or highly knowledgeable about CAADP prior to the trainings, and many of them were linked to Ministries of Agriculture CAADP working groups or had been involved in their countries&rsquo; CAADP roundtable process.</p>
                           <p>In most of the countries almost all Task One Champions asked to participate in the Lessons Learned study agreed. Logistics constraints meant that most interviews were conducted in the capitals of the 10 countries. (Except for Ghana, where interviews were also held in Tamale.) In several countries respondents travelled considerable distances at their own expense for their interview, and Africa Lead staff also took advantage of Champions who were coming to the capital for other reasons to schedule interviews. Both of these strategies minimized potential bias introduced into the sample by conducting interviews in the capital.</p>
                           <strong>Key informant interviews</strong>
                           <p>Key informant interviews were based on a standard, open-ended topic guide and list of probe questions generated through discussions on the priority learning agenda with US and Africa-based Africa Lead staff and other stakeholders prior to the fieldwork. During the interviews, which took from one to three hours, Champions discussed their experiences of the Africa Lead trainings and the impact the trainings have had on their lives and work. For most respondents the interview provided a rare opportunity to reflect on an important development program, and they took it very seriously. They discussed how Africa Lead Task One trainings compared to other trainings they had taken; which aspects were important to them and why; if and how the trainings had changed their knowledge, beliefs, attitudes or behaviors; what they did post-training and the extent to which it was influenced by their experience of Africa Lead; recommendations to improve and build on Africa Lead going forward; and more general reflections on capacity building for agriculture and on the relevance of CAADP to their national agriculture agendas.</p>
                           <p>All ten country studies were conducted by Dr. Katharine Coon and Nega Bechera (Winrock International technical advisor and MSI monitoring and evaluation specialist) using the standard topic guide. Coon and Bechera conducted the first two country studies (Kenya and Tanzania) together in order to standardize their approach to the interviews. After that, Coon conducted the Uganda, Ghana, Liberia, Nigeria and Senegal country studies, while Bechera conducted Ethiopia, Zimbabwe and Zambia. Africa Lead&rsquo;s M&amp;E officer for East Africa (Rosemary Kagunda) participated in the interviews conducted in Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda.</p>
                           <strong>Data management and analysis</strong>
                           <p>Before starting interviews the purpose and scope of the study and the contents of the topic guide were explained to respondents. Respondents were then asked for permission to record and transcribe their interview so what they said could factor into the findings of the study. At the same time, respondents were assured that their anonymity would be maintained by delinking their names from any reports of the findings. For the most part, organizations have not been named either, with three exceptions where naming the organization significantly improves the readers appreciation of the findings, and where the findings were not sensitive. Most respondents agreed to have their interviews recorded and interviews took from one to three hours to conduct. Interviews were transcribed in Nairobi and Accra. Transcripts range from less than 30 to over 70 pages, with the majority between 30 &ndash; 50 pages in length.</p>
                           <p>Analysis of the transcripts was conducted by Africa Lead Washington D.C. based staff including David Tardif-Douglin, Gathoni Mungai, Melanie Beth Oliviero and Katharine Coon. Each one analyzed transcripts from two &ndash; three country studies. For each transcript, they identified themes in the responses organized by the main sections of the topic guide, and then clustered the themes across respondents for each of the country study. Katharine Coon synthesized the country analyses into the main synthesis report, which is also informed by her first-hand participation in the majority of the country studies and interviews. Quotes from transcripts that are used in the report are identified by country, a respondent number and the sector from which the respondent comes (Ghana R1 national government). This provides basic context for understanding the observations and perspectives of the Champions while also preserving their anonymity. Two regional organizations (Association for Strengthening Agricultural Research in Eastern and Central Africa (ASARECA) headquartered in Entebbe, Uganda and East Africa Grain Council (EAGC) headquartered in Nairobi, Uganda), and one national association (National Association of Poultry Farmers (NAPF) in Ghana) have been identified by name in quotes and case studies presented in Part Three, since all had multiple Champions, and the specific individual participating in the interview in not named. <a name="_Toc227825634"></a></p>
                           <strong>Level of analysis and focus of report</strong>
                           <p>The focus of this report is on Africa Lead&rsquo;s Task One leadership and management trainings, and not on elements of the other three tasks. There were several reasons for restricting the report&rsquo;s focus in this way. First, as of July and August 2012 when the Lessons Learned research was being conducted, only 52 individuals had gone on internships sponsored by Africa Lead; of these, four were interviewed for the Lessons Learned research. This represents too few to assess the internship program or to contrast internships to leadership and management trainings in terms of impact. The same is true of the institutional assessments and tailored capacity building implemented by the Africa Lead program in West Africa. While acknowledging that this is an important and innovative use of Africa Lead tasks, assessing its impact on institutional performance was outside the scope or methodology of the Lessons Learned research.</p>
                           <p>Within Task One, the level of analysis presented in the main synthesis report is continent-wide. In other words, the report focuses on findings about the impacts of transformational leadership and management training on <em>individuals </em>that were common across the country studies. Of course, there is variance among individuals in how they responded to the trainings, with some more intensely transformed and mobilized than others. But <em>variance in how Champions responded to the training, in terms of its impact on them as human beings, appears to be more related to differences in personality or character than to differences in the sector or country the Champions came from. </em></p>
                           <p>While this report focuses on individual level findings common across countries, each country study also had unique themes common to interviews with that country&rsquo;s Champions; and likewise there were perspectives that appear to have been characteristic of Champions from different sectors. This type of inter-country and inter-sector variance came out more in the kinds of goals and actions Champions engaged in post-training, than in how they actually responded to the training itself. In terms of this report, between country or between sector differences are mostly touched on in Part Four, which deals with recommendations for follow-on&rsquo;s to Africa Lead.</p>
                           <p>Findings are brought to life with illustrative quotes and stories that express sentiments or ideas common to Champions irrespective of country. Although illustrative quotes and stories are drawn mainly from Ghana, Liberia, Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania, nine of the ten country studies have been analyzed and the findings presented here are reflective of all nine. Ethiopian interviews were conducted in Amharic, which has prevented their inclusion in this report.</p>
                           <p>Findings from key informant interviews are presented in the two sections that follow. These are organized around</p>

                           <p>Part Three presents analysis of Champions&rsquo; r<em>esponses</em> to questions about their experiences of the leadership and management training workshops. The goal of the analysis was to identify what the Champions themselves have to say about best practices piloted by Africa Lead, as well as about possible impact pathways linking the trainings to changes in their attitudes and values. The last section of Part Three is comprised of illustrative case studies that explore different ways Champions applied transformative leadership and management training in their work.</p>
                           <p>Part Four presents Champions&rsquo; feedback on ways to improve Task One training methodologies, and also r<em>ecommendations </em>for Africa Lead going forward &ndash; including what next for leadership and management training and what next for Champions and Champions networks.</p>

                           </h1>
                           <strong>Motivation to take trainings</strong>
                           <p>Through consultation with USAID Missions, other projects and peers, Africa Lead asked for suggestions on outstanding people who have capacity for leadership to invite to participate in trainings. In this way, Africa Lead attempted to apply a selection filter that would only accept individuals with strong leadership potential to participate. In East Africa the invitation letter for the workshops was very clear about the purpose of the training: to build a cadre of leaders with knowledge of the CAADP framework able to drive the agriculture agenda forward. In West Africa Champions were asked filled out a form stating what they hoped to contribute as food security Champions based on what they learned. The filter process appears to have been somewhat successful in that many of the Champions interviewed were clearly excited by the chance to learn about CAADP, to become part of a cadre of leaders for food security, and to develop high order skills tailored to issues in food security and agriculture that they grapple with in their work.</p>
                           <p>The following quotes from Kenya, Uganda and Ghana are illustrative.</p>
                           <p>&ldquo;The invitation letter was very clear about the purpose, which was to focus on regional agriculture and on the linkage with the CAADP process. And it was also very clear about targeting people who can really drive the agriculture agenda forward. So when I got this invitation I was excited and felt it was a good investment of my time. It is a decision which I don&rsquo;t regret.&rdquo;&nbsp; (Kenya R3 local NGO)</p>
                           <p>&ldquo;What really inspired me was what it aimed to achieve &ndash; linking us to CAADP. For me this was a first because [before the training] I would say as an organization we have not had any link to CAADP&rdquo; (Kenya R2 regional trade facilitation organization)</p>
                           <p>&ldquo;Based on subjects that were taught at the training I was eager to attend because I thought the training would improve me in my day-to-day activities in the institute. How to form teams, strategic thinking, preparing for change within an establishment&hellip;leadership qualities, basically. I was also excited by the opportunity to learn about CAADP and to build my leadership skills to advance food security in Ghana.&rdquo; (Ghana R2 national research organization)</p>
                           <p>&ldquo;When I saw the content and goal of the training, I realized that I am a leader. In the work I do in HIV we are promoting nutrition, so I realized the training would be very useful to me and to the church.&rdquo;&nbsp; (Uganda R9 church leader)</p>
                           <p>&nbsp;&ldquo;We realized we need to engage government on certain policies in order to improve the poultry sector in our country and we were not finding our way. Things were not clear to us. So we decided to take this opportunity to learn how to engage with the government, to learn how to educate the government what the poultry business is all about. So I attended [for my organization] and it has been very useful.&rdquo; (Ghana R10 national farmer-based organization)</p>
                           <p>All three Africa Lead offices asked known food security leaders to identify participants for Task One workshops. In EA a respondent in this position described his motivation to nominate others for the trainings based on his belief that the transformative methodology has potential to revolutionize agriculture in his country.</p>
                           <p>&ldquo;I was in an instrumental position in that [I was asked to recruit trainees from outside Kenya]... Being [based] in Nairobi, I was fortunate to know what the Champions trainings were about. So I made sure a lot of Tanzanians came. Because we have challenges in our agriculture, despite having a lot of land, a lot of potential, we are not doing well. So I wanted a lot of people [from Tanzania] to participate in order to revolutionize agriculture in Tanzania. What I can say briefly is that the training was quite inspirational.&rdquo; (Tanzania R1 regional organization then U.N. agency)</p>
                           <p>Although most Champions participated in Africa Lead workshops by choice and met the criteria the program was seeking, a significant minority attended because Africa Lead contacted the heads of their organizations and they were selected to attend by their boss. Although there are examples of this from all four sectors, it was more frequent among Champions recruited from government ministries and large NGOs with frequent donor contact. Even so, many who were &ldquo;told&rdquo; to attend were affected by the training in significant and positive ways. In one of the more perceptive and thoughtful interviews, a government Champion from Ghana discussed why his agency sent him to the Africa Lead training.</p>
                           <p>&ldquo;Human resources is concerned about the role (my ministry) will play connecting with Agriculture to alleviate poverty and food insecurity. They sent me to prepare me to liaise with Agriculture. In fact, the whole thing is about food security, so cross-cutting linking is important. On paper Ministry of Finance, Agriculture and Ministry of Trade and Industry are supposed to coordinate very closely. But in reality we miss the linkages. We do not communicate or coordinate, so we miss each other&rsquo;s priorities. Africa Lead gave a place and taught skills to connect with each other.&rdquo;&nbsp; (Ghana R1 national government)</p>
                           <strong>Best practices identified by Champions</strong>
                           <p><strong>Champions&rsquo; responses to questions about the most significant or memorable aspects of the training workshops were mostly consistent across all the country studies. The points distilled from the interviews reflect their feedback on <em>&ldquo;best practices&rdquo;</em> and are: </strong></p>
                           <p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Residential nature of training</p>
                           <p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Diversity of participants</p>
                           <p><strong>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>Use of symbols, stories and games</p>
                           <p><strong>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>Holistic, multi-disciplinary approach to content</p>
                           <p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Use of African vernacular </p>
                           <p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pragmatic and action-oriented</p>
                           <p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; High quality of the facilitators and facilitation</p>
                           <h3>Residential Nature of Training</h3>
                           <p>The residential design gave Champions a chance to focus on the workshop content without being distracted by their regular roles and duties, which also facilitated opening up to their emotions over the course of the training. The fact that it was residential also meant participants spent time in the evening socializing, which was mentioned as important for building trust and forging bonds with each other.</p>
                           <h3>Diversity of Participants</h3>
                           <p>Regional Diversity. Champions from all four sectors valued the regional diversity of their cohorts because it gave them a chance to learn about what is happening in other countries, compare challenges and forge bonds with other leaders and/or potential business partners across their regions. This was key to building the ability of Champions to move beyond local contexts to think and function as regional food systems actors.</p>
                           <p>Diversity in Sector and Expertise. The diversity of Champions from different sectors (private, NGO, research and universities, and public) was also cited as an important aspect of the trainings. Even within the public sector, the training sought to include people from different Ministries so they could each identify their roles. Spending time in workshops with people whom they may not have otherwise met helped Champions learn about value chains and understand perspectives other than their own. This was key in a range of outcomes including better understanding of the systems nature of agriculture and food security, improved policy and economic literacy, and enhanced ability of Champions to communicate, to network and to engage with a wider range of food systems actors than before.</p>
                           <p><strong><em>Diversity in Statuses.</em></strong> Diversity of participants&rsquo; statuses based on age, education and role authority was cited by Champions in Ghana and Senegal as an important part of their experience, although there is evidence it was important everywhere. Being able to interact freely and openly with people of different ages and role statuses in a safe environment, where everyone is treated with the same respect, seems to have had an important psychological impact linked to the heightened sense of empowerment and courage Champions attributed to the training.</p>
                           <h3>Use of Symbols, Stories and Games</h3>
                           <p>The visual images, stories and games used by Africa Lead functioned like traditional or religious proverbs, providing non-conceptual mental maps that helped workshop participants internalize new ways of seeing the world and new attitudes at a very deep level. Champions&rsquo; narratives suggest that this was a key factor in the transformational impact of their experience. The unconventional pedagogy created a sense of personal identification and urgency, opened Champions&rsquo; minds and motivated them to take in and absorb the content at a deep, transformative level. It was key to generating the motivational energy and drive to act as Champions once the trainings had ended. The overall impact of transformative pedagogy was captured by a Ghanaian Champion:</p>
                           <blockquote style="width:auto;">&ldquo;We did so many exercises that helped us to know we can&rsquo;t stay where we are, but need to stretch, move ahead, extend to other areas, and to help us know how to link up and partner with each other to get more out of our efforts. So Africa Lead is an eye opener, encouraging us to share ideas to see how we can best increase our production and food security.&rdquo; <cite>Ghana R9 farmer-based organization</cite></blockquote>
                           <p>Although a majority of the 116 Champions interviews reflect impacts of transformative methods, there was significant variation in which image, story, metaphor or game different Champions remembered. Given diversity of learning styles among adults, inclusion of a rich and varied set of transformative methods may be an important factor in the workshops&rsquo; overall impact. The combination of transformative methods working together may also be needed since different techniques embedded in different modules target unconscious attitudes or beliefs related to that module.</p>
                           <p>The following quotes from Uganda and Ghana illustrate how different Champions interpret the broken pot differently, based on their contexts. Yet within this diversity of interpretation and use, the symbol itself serves as a reminder that the common goal of everyone&rsquo;s effort is to end food insecurity in their country, and that in order for this to happen, everyone needs to pull together.</p>
                           <blockquote style="width:auto;">&ldquo;The training was a great experience that we went through. But above all there was this lesson about mending a broken pot. It led us to really analyze gaps in our research program. That session on mending the broken pot actually strengthened our resolve to work in a value chain way. In fact, when we came back we saw ourselves really emphasizing the value chain so now we go from laboratory to the consumer.&rdquo; <cite>Uganda R11 regional research organization</cite></blockquote>
                           <blockquote style="width:auto;">&ldquo;I remember that broken pot very well. I look at it this way. In Ghana what we need to be food secure is in place, but it is a bit shattered. Working through people and bringing our acts together can help us piece things together. We have the resources. That&rsquo;s why I said the people aspect is very crucial, because we are the ones who have to make things stick.&rdquo;&nbsp; <cite>Ghana R5 government</cite></blockquote>
                           <blockquote style="width:auto;">&ldquo;We have to look at increasing our production, getting more to eat and then not having an empty pot. I always use the pot which is not leaking [in her motivational meetings with women farmers]. Now all the food is leaking and the pot is getting empty, but we need to close it so we can get more production in the pot.&rdquo; <cite>Ghana R9 farmer-based organization</cite></blockquote>
                           <p>An important finding on the transformative pedagogy is the way transformative elements have stuck with Champions, continuing to resurface in their minds 12 to 18 months after they took the workshop. The illustrative quotes showing how this worked are from the Ghana case study. The following is from a discussion of the &ldquo;little girl&rdquo; by a woman with an academic degree in gender.</p>
                           <blockquote style="width:auto;">&ldquo;Those metaphors, I don&rsquo;t remember them all, but the little girl is the one that has stuck in my mind and made me think. It has impacted my approach to issues I just talked about, gender, climate change and nutrition. You know, I saw that little girl as the embodiment of these three concepts. Malnutrition has affected her life, and climate change will make it worse. She has impacted my approach to the programs we do. We are not a gender advocacy organization. But now I always make sure I highlight women. It&rsquo;s not that I didn&rsquo;t know of these things before, because my master&rsquo;s focus was gender and development. But I didn&rsquo;t think about it much until after [the Africa Lead workshop] because what I did was academic. I know I have seen children who are not well fed; when we go out to the farms they are there. But we never give them any thought. It takes something to make you sit back and say &ldquo;Really, I think this is it.&rdquo;&nbsp; We talked at length about that little girl, and I remember during the discussion I became very emotional about it, because I was looking at.. [emotional moment; respondent did not finish sentence].&nbsp; We talked about how the girl would be in years to come if she is not well fed. Africa Lead turned it from being an academic thing to a hard thing. It&rsquo;s not academic anymore.&rdquo;&nbsp; <cite>Ghana R6 farmer-based organization)</cite></blockquote>
                           <p>Games also triggered powerful &ldquo;Aa Ha&rdquo; moments that shifted Champions into new ways of perceiving, experiencing and thinking about leadership and teamwork. The following quotes from Ghana illustrate the importance of games in triggering this kind of insight, even among highly educated people.</p>
                           <blockquote style="width:auto;">&ldquo;Did Africa Lead give you skills you did not have before?&rdquo; &ldquo;It really did, especially the module about teamwork. In fact, there was one game during the training [Roadblock].&nbsp; At first people got confused, but in the end they said &lsquo;Oh, we did not understand, but now we do.&rsquo;&nbsp; In Roadblock a leader will emerge and be pushing people around. Sometimes he doesn&rsquo;t know his left from his right and he insists do it this way, do it that, but its failing. Then you see someone who is quiet, but he is looking at how to unravel the whole thing, so by the time he speaks he gets the answer. There are people who are forward, that is their life; that is how they speak. Others take their time before they speak. So you have to know the different types and how to manage them.&rdquo;&nbsp; <cite>Ghana R1 national government</cite></blockquote>
                           <blockquote style="width:auto">&ldquo;We did an exercise on the roadblock. And I got to know what planning can do, what teamwork can do. So the first thing I did when I came home, the first thing I did in my office, and it has come to stay, is that I said every Monday head of all of the departments will have a team meeting and plan together. And it has helped a lot.&rdquo;&nbsp; <cite>Ghana R12 microfinance/NGO</cite></blockquote>
                           <p>Another Ghanaian Champion, this one with a Ph.D., used the phrase &ldquo;thinking outside the box&rdquo; dozens of times during his interview to describe changes in his thinking and behavior brought about by Africa Lead that he linked to a game played at the training.</p>
                           <blockquote style="width:auto">&ldquo;Before the training I was not going out of my way. But the training empowered me to do more because we were taught to think outside the box&hellip;. Thinking outside the box. We were given nine dots on a piece of paper which you form a straight line without crossing. And it was interesting, because a lot of us couldn&rsquo;t do it. I have brought it back to my colleagues and I have yet to find someone who can do it. This is something that always comes back to me, thinking outside the box.&rdquo;&nbsp; <cite>Ghana R2 national research organization</cite></blockquote>
                           <h3>Holistic, Multi-Disciplinary Approach to Content</h3>
                           <p>The holistic, multi-disciplinary approach to workshop content was new and very important to many of the Champions who were interviewed. It combined content on CAADP and food security with content on leadership, change management, and managing for results in ways that helped participants deepen their understanding of the CAADP framework as an interdependent system made up of multiple stakeholders with different concerns and perspectives. At the same time it has given them skills needed to move their own professional behavior into alignment with CAADP principles and values. Several Champions were already at the cutting edge in their different contexts, for example through work on value chain methodologies, trying to establish multi-disciplinary approaches within research organizations, or trying to improve collaboration between government ministries or between government and non-state actors. The workshop boosted their confidence as change agents since it deepened their understanding of the CAADP framework and how their own work fits into it. At the same time it has given them practical skills to take action based on CAADP principles.</p>
                           <blockquote style="width:auto">&ldquo;One of the things this training got right, it was holistic. For the first time we had a deep understanding of CAADP. Even though we have been working with CAADP, it was our first opportunity to really discuss what it represents and what it means for us as Champions within our own work. At the same time the training taught us leadership and new methods for working together.&rdquo; <cite>Uganda R11 regional research organization</cite></blockquote>
                           <p>One of the main findings from the Lessons Learned research is the high value Champions placed on the opportunity to learn practical leadership and management skills. Elements from Kouzes&rsquo; and Posner&rsquo;s leadership model, the Kotter model for managing change, and the Rapid Results Institute&rsquo;s 100-day methods were all important takeaways, <em>especially methods for active listening and leading by example, team building, stakeholder analysis, evidence based advocacy and managing for transparency and results.</em></p>
                           <blockquote style="width:auto">&ldquo;The Kotter approach was a major takeaway, because after the second day, I realized this is what we need to engage government. You know, the steps, how to even encourage ordinary people around us. So when we started going on air [in a lobbying campaign inspired by Africa Lead] we were telling all the farmers you matter, you are part of us, you need to be with us. And with the Rapid Results we are now mobilizing our members. Everything has completely shifted; it&rsquo;s completely opened up. And it&rsquo;s all because of this program [Africa Lead]. We&rsquo;ve been able to know exactly how to talk to them [government, farmers, the private sector], the messages to send out. And people are listening.&rdquo;&nbsp; <cite>Ghana R10 farmer-based organization</cite></blockquote>
                           <p>The following Champion referred to the practical leadership and management methods taught as &ldquo;soft skills,&rdquo; and highlighted how essential she feels they are in order to motivate people to go beyond theory to action.</p>
                           <blockquote style="width:auto">&ldquo;I realized with [Africa Lead] there are also the soft skills aspects that come in [along with technical content]. I benefited a lot from people management, conflict management, especially the Thomas-Kilmann Instrument [model for handling conflict]. That has really helped us bond. I emphasize soft skills because you can have all the theory, but it&rsquo;s people who do the implementation and we all have our challenges. So it&rsquo;s very important [for managers and leader] to know how to get the best out of people so they can commit and work as a team. That&rsquo;s why the people aspect is very, very crucial. Knowledge rests within individuals, but you need to be able to elicit that response to get things going. We can read all the theory but it won&rsquo;t mean anything. It takes a common goal.&rdquo;&nbsp; <cite>Ghana R5 national government</cite></blockquote>
                           <p>Discussions of leadership or management methods were often linked to each other and to other elements of the training. For example, learning to manage for results was linked to changes in the sense of urgency to address food insecurity, and to changes in ways participants thought about time. Exercises that helped Champions learn to value diverse personalities and perspectives were linked to new norms of leadership emphasizing active listening and personal responsibility for modeling ethical standards and altruism. Both were linked to changes in how Champions experienced themselves away from isolated actors unconnected to a broader system, to experiencing themselves as part of a bigger system where everyone needs to pull together to end food insecurity. Shifts from silo to systems thinking were linked to CAADP. When Champions grasped the CAADP framework they also understood why they needed inclusive, transparent and accountable leadership and management to bridge the gap between the theory of CAADP and practice on the ground.</p>
                           <p>The following section quoted from an interview with a Tanzanian Champion is illustrative of how the themes of urgency, shifts in values, and learning about CAADP work together in a synergistic way to shift Champions&rsquo; views, values and behavior.</p>
                           <blockquote style="width:auto"><em>&ldquo;Did anything about the training especially influence you?&rdquo;&nbsp; </em>&ldquo;I think the poor girl and the broken pot, because this is a common situation in our place, a number of people are in the condition of the poor girl, so I remember that very much.&rdquo;&nbsp; <em>&ldquo;Could you say how that has influenced you?&rdquo;&nbsp; </em>&ldquo;I can say it has influenced me in trying to do hard work and take responsibility, because I understand the need to change.&rdquo; <em>&ldquo;Would you say your work has changed since the training?&rdquo; </em>&nbsp;&ldquo;Yes. I work harder because if I reflect on the CAADP pillars, I see the meaning of it and I see the need to work on those pillars. They [the four pillars] actually display the work I need to do.&rdquo;&nbsp; <em>&ldquo;Before the training did you connect your work to food security?&rdquo;</em>&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, but before the training it was not organized, not clear. The training on CAADP has given me a reference, where I can connect my work with the initiatives being undertaken by my country. I can see which part I&rsquo;m falling in. Before the training it was difficult for me to know that what I do is important, but with [CAADP] I have the reference now.&rdquo; <cite>Tanzania R12 sub-national government</cite></blockquote>
                           <p>An important consequence of the shift from silo to systems has to do with new awareness of the importance of human nutrition on the part of many Champions, who had really never thought of this as part of food security before. For example, for some years prior to the trainings, ASARECA had been moving towards a value chain approach in putting together multi-disciplinary research teams for different crop value chains. Although lip service was given to its importance, nutrition was under-researched relative to other crop attributes. After Task One trainings senior staff from ASARECA began to integrate nutritional values and other crop properties of concern to final consumers (such as cooking attributes and taste) into their research agendas, as well as began to study &ldquo;orphan crops&rdquo; with high potential for human nutrition.</p>
                           <blockquote style="width:auto">&ldquo;Then, I think there was one thing in our research portfolio, it was neglected [prior to Africa Lead], the issue of nutrition&hellip;. When we had this [Africa Lead] session on nutrition, it enabled us to really highlight it as a priority within the value chain approach; we felt that was very useful.&rdquo; <em>&ldquo;Has that changed things here?&rdquo;</em>&nbsp; &ldquo;It has changed things, because [now] every project literally has a small section, or big section, for that matter, on nutrition.&rdquo; <cite>Uganda R11, regional organization</cite></blockquote>
                           <h3>Practical Experiential Learning and Action Oriented Approach</h3>
                           <p>Africa Lead&rsquo;s curricula designers integrated the workshop&rsquo;s transformative pedagogical elements and multi-disciplinary content into practical participatory exercises that Champions worked on together. Working in teams gave Champions a way to share their expertise and knowledge with each other over the course of the week, which nurtured understanding and respect for their diversity of roles, personalities and perspectives. In a way, the workshop itself was a practicum for the skills being taught. Importantly, this approach helped desensitize participants&rsquo; shyness or fear of communicating openly in front of people from different countries, status, or sectors.</p>
                           <p>&nbsp;&ldquo;It [Africa Lead] is not conventional. It&rsquo;s different from the usual training where you have one or two people with a set agenda running everything from beginning to end. Here we had lots of people bringing in new perspectives. It&rsquo;s highly interactive and everyone is equal, lots of exercises, everybody participates, everybody has to say something. In most trainings people sit, listen, write notes. Here everyone has to participate. It makes a big difference in terms of motivation, in terms of personal appreciation. It fires you up, you come out a different person.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Uganda R11 regional research organization)</p>
                           <p>The workshop facilitators also constantly challenged participants to go beyond the abstract thinking common in agriculture sector planning by bringing their focus back to <em>action</em>. What real life actions could they, in their own lives and circumstances, undertake to address food insecurity? &nbsp;Champions mentioned that the case studies and scenarios they developed together were especially practical and useful to them in this regard. </p>
                           <h3><strong>Use of African Vernacular</strong></h3>
                           <p>In addition to general comments, some Champions mentioned the use of African vernacular as having been an important factor that helped participants relax and open up to each other.</p>
                           <p>&ldquo;The language was down to earth. When we entered, most of us were afraid; hey, these people are coming to speak the Queen&rsquo;s English, big English. We may not understand what is going on. But at the opening [of the workshop] they [the facilitators] tried to break the fears; make it down to earth. And we were free to ask questions; the whole training was participatory. There were a lot of icebreakers, group work.&rdquo;&nbsp; (Ghana R11 NGO)</p>
                           <h3>High Quality of The Facilitation</h3>
                           <p>Champions from every country mentioned the high quality of the facilitators at the workshops, including the training managers who were present at most of them. What stood out was the range of skills the facilitators used -- from participatory adult learning and transformative pedagogy to knowledge of technical content related to CAADP, food security, leadership and management. Champions observed that this level of skill is unusual for capacity building workshops in Africa, and suggested it is one of the &ldquo;best practices&rdquo; that contributed to the impact. If facilitators had not been able to establish an environment where it was safe for people from different countries, sectors and statuses to express their emotions openly in front of each other, while at the same time keeping them engaged with technical content, the transformative impacts of the workshops may not have occurred to the extent that they did.</p>
                           <strong>Changes in attitudes and values Champions attribute to trainings</strong>
                           <p>Changes in Champions&rsquo; knowledge related to CAADP, integrated food security frameworks, and to new knowledge of leadership and management methodologies have been captured by Africa Lead&rsquo;s regular M&amp;E activities, which show that the trainings significantly increased Champions&rsquo; knowledge of these subjects. This section of the report takes that as its starting point. It focuses on Champions&rsquo; observations about how the workshop changed their thinking. In the interviews this is used as shorthand for attitudes and values.</p>
                           <p>After discussing aspects of the Africa Lead trainings that had been significant for them, Champions were asked if the trainings had influenced or changed their thinking in any way. Except for a few outliers (less than 15%), most Champions did attribute long-term changes in their thinking to their experience of Africa Lead. Their responses cluster around a set of closely correlated themes including:&nbsp;</p>
                           <p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Urgency to address food insecurity</p>
                           <p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stronger work ethics</p>
                           <p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More open and altruistic leadership</p>
                           <p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Personal empowerment to speak out and to act</p>
                           <p>As with best practices, emphases placed on different attitudes and values vary considerably among Champions reflecting their diversity of personalities, contexts, perspectives and experiences.</p>
                           <h3><strong>Urgency About Food Security</strong></h3>
                           <p>Creating urgency to address food insecurity was a key objective of the transformative methodology pioneered by Africa Lead. Feelings of personal identification and urgency about food security give rise to the motivation and drive Champions&rsquo; need to become drivers of change in their own local, national or regional contexts. The sense of urgency generated by the trainings tapped into Champions&rsquo; altruism and motivated them to examine and change other attitudes and values related to food systems transformation.</p>
                           <p>For many Champions urgency manifested as anger at not being able to go beyond policy frameworks and theory to real action to end food insecurity. In Kenya this was linked to intense frustration many of the Champions felt over the famine that afflicted Kenya in 2011.</p>
                           <blockquote style="width:auto">&ldquo;The [Africa Lead] methodology left a big impact on my mind. Something that has really touched me is the fact that despite all the good ideas we have, why aren&rsquo;t we able to address food security in this region?&nbsp; Because a lot of work has been done. There are great policies and ideas coming forth. So what are we doing wrong?&nbsp; Why aren&rsquo;t we seeing tangible results?&nbsp; Why is it that every time there is a drought our people start to die and we start looking for food aid to feed them?&nbsp; Why can&rsquo;t we look for a long-lasting solution?&nbsp; That has really provoked anger in my mind and I really wonder what can be done to address this problem. That is what has really struck me.&rdquo; <cite>Kenya R13 private sector</cite></blockquote>
                           <p>Informants in Senegal linked urgency to taking a more proactive, forward approach to planning and thinking about time. For example:</p>
                           <blockquote style="width:auto">&ldquo;In Senegal people don&rsquo;t consider urgency until it is almost too late; they don&rsquo;t anticipate so as to eliminate or reduce the likelihood and impact of urgent situations and crises.&rdquo;&nbsp; <cite>Senegal R5 NGO</cite></blockquote>
                           <p>Ghanaian Champions also connected urgency to shifting values around planning and time use, as illustrated by the following quote.</p>
                           <blockquote style="width:auto"><em>&ldquo;Did the training influence or change your thinking in any way?&rdquo;&nbsp; </em>&ldquo;Yes, it did. It brought the urgency to the fore. Because of that, teamwork, planning and monitoring and evaluation were my three key takeaways. Because most of the time we have good plans, but we are not able to monitor or evaluate to see if we achieve our objectives or deviate from them. Most of the time we take things for granted as part of our work, but as part of Module One I was introduced to the fact that every aspect of our projects should be well planned. When you plan it cuts unnecessary costs, unnecessary time, and keeps you focused. As I was saying, the training brought to fore the urgency. If we fail to plan and to collaborate with one another, then the negative ripples on the country are so great.&rdquo;&nbsp; <cite>Ghana R1 national government</cite></blockquote>
                           <p>In others, urgency motivated Champions to look self-critically at their own attitudes towards leadership and responsibility &ndash; and shifted them to taking personal responsibility for bringing about food security.</p>
                           <blockquote style="width:auto">&ldquo;If I were to point out just one thing that stands out about the training [it would be] creating urgency for change and making me responsible, even at the organizational level. It has always been that we look to the CEO to initiate change, we look to the Board of directors to initiate change. In the past that has been our mentality. If there is one thing I would single out, it&rsquo;s putting me at the center of responsibility, it&rsquo;s that I must help bring change in food security.&rdquo; &nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Going back to the training, did the training influence the way you think?&rdquo; </em>&nbsp;&ldquo;I think in two ways for me. Putting it simple, the fact that I am responsible. Because I am responsible, when I wake up in the morning I feel that I must know what I am doing; in a word, responsibility makes me accountable. Secondly, that sense of urgency that we need to have done this yesterday. Those two have been very powerful paradigm [shifts] for me.&rdquo; <cite>Kenya R3 regional organization</cite></blockquote>
                           <h3><strong>Stronger Work Ethics</strong></h3>
                           <p>Although only a few Champions used the term &ldquo;work ethic&rdquo; many described working harder and trying to manage time more effectively as one of the impacts the trainings had on them.</p>
                           <blockquote style="width:auto">&ldquo;The training has deepened my work ethics. There were quite a lot of instructions that were spread out that are very relevant to the way one handles things in a businessman type way, for example the issue of time management. People take it [time management] very casually, but we had a very good and in-depth analysis of how one can manage one&rsquo;s time in the workplace, and this has really helped many of us move to where we are now.&rdquo; <cite>Uganda R11 regional research organization</cite></blockquote>
                           <h3><strong>More Open and Altruistic Leadership</strong></h3>
                           <p>Leadership was the subject of the training and many of the Champions interviewed identified themselves as leaders, so in a way everything discussed in this report deals with different aspects of leadership. This section provides a brief description of traditional as well as modern leadership norms that came out in the research and examples of how Champions were affected by Africa Lead in their personal evolution as leaders. In much of Africa, leadership authority has traditionally been held by older people. High value is placed on showing respect for elders and for authority. Followers are expected to act as dependents, relying on their leaders to make decisions and to provide. As a result, leadership tends to be one-way and top down in terms of communication and directives. Directives flow down to staff, to clients or to beneficiaries through hierarchically defined networks. Conformity tends to be rewarded, information horded as a source of power, and there is little demand for accountability.</p>
                           <p>At the same time, a new model of a modern leader/manager who communicates freely across hierarchies and between groups is emerging in Africa. This type of leader empowers staff, network members, clients and beneficiaries, encourages teamwork, collaboration and innovation, and models values of responsibility, transparency and accountability in their own behavior. Africa Lead created a desire to become more progressive leaders. Evidence from interviews with the Champions suggest that many of them responded to the trainings by shifting towards progressive models of leadership for the first time, or by strengthening their skills to become stronger progressive leaders within their contexts.</p>
                           <p>Although leadership is multi-faceted, a dimension of change described by many of the Champions involved a new sense of the importance of leader as someone who reaches out, listens, mentors and models the way. The trainings gave Champions skills to communicate laterally with colleagues and partners, or vertically with staff or farmers in a much freer way than before. A number of respondents pointed to &ldquo;active listening&rdquo; taught in the trainings and credit it with improving how they interact with colleagues and counterparts. The trainings helped them more actively seek the thoughts and inputs of others and to better analyze their own strengths and weaknesses, thereby changing their approach to problem solving. This impacted leadership, in that many Champions described seeking input from their own staff, from clients or from beneficiaries for the first time after the trainings.</p>
                           <p>The following quote is from a Champion who is a senior church leader. The training &ldquo;opened his eyes&rdquo; to the reality that most of his parishioners are farmers, and made him question the morality of asking them to support the church, when the church made no effort to understand or support them as farmers.</p>
                           <blockquote style="width:auto">&ldquo;Being a pastor, the training really opened my eyes. Before the training I used to preach on the pulpit and did not think about the fact that majority of our church members are farmers. We know the money they bring to the church they have gotten from farms. But we are just up here as leaders. We don&rsquo;t know what they are doing down there. We don&rsquo;t know what is in their gardens. We are not encouraging them. We don&rsquo;t know if the money they are giving us is making them hungry. I have realized that we [the church] don&rsquo;t have any department responsible for agriculture or food security, yet majority of our members get their money from agriculture.&rdquo;&nbsp; <cite>Uganda R9 church leader</cite></blockquote>
                           <p>Following the training, this Champion began visiting his rural parishioners to pray with them in their gardens and farms for the first time. He also started a small farm of his own so that he can understand their struggles trying to achieve food security. Although it will take time, his goal is to sensitize the rest of the church leaders to the importance of agriculture in the lives of their parishioners, and to establish a department in the church responsible for agriculture and food security issues.</p>
                           <p>A Ghanaian Champion observed that transformative leadership training makes people less selfish and competitive, and more willing to share information.</p>
                           <blockquote style="width:auto">>&ldquo;Africa Lead opened our eyes for sharing. Sharing is something we don&rsquo;t do. People don&rsquo;t want to share their knowledge and experience. Like we talk of networks. We are in networks, but when it comes to sharing, people still hide information. There is a need for a lot of change, and Africa Lead is one organization that can bring about such changes in Ghana, because it takes a lot of work to change attitudes of leaders, to change selfish leadership. This is very important, this capacity building on leadership; we haven&rsquo;t experienced much of it before [Africa Lead].&rdquo; <cite>Ghana R11 &nbsp;traditional chief,&nbsp; NGO founder</cite></blockquote>
                           <p>In both East and West Africa, exposure to transformative leadership training changed the way that mid-level career civil servants conceive of their roles, becoming less selfish in their behavior towards farmers and more open to &ldquo;bottom-up&rdquo; input from staff and farmers. In Liberia a Champion who was a district director of agriculture extension changed his management style 180 degrees after the training. Before the training, he passed directives from the ministry down to his staff, but he never held staff meetings, never asked his staff to inform him about conditions in the community and never held meetings with community stakeholders. After the training he established weekly staff meetings where he actively solicited his staff&rsquo;s input, and began regular monthly meeting with local community stakeholders in his district.</p>
                           <p>In Tanzania, one of the Champions has had a long civil service career in irrigation and is senior at the sub-national level. Since he took the training, he has more direct contact with farmers than before and quality of his interactions with them has changed.</p>
                           <blockquote style="width:auto"><em>&ldquo;Can you describe ways the training influenced your work?&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;&ldquo;Yes. First of all, the training mentioned clearly about leadership, that we need to be leaders going ahead of others. So this serves as encouragement to work hard. And leaders also need to get other people to change, that was clearly mentioned [in the training]. A lot of changes are needed among our farmers. So since the training we are encouraging farmers more to take steps in changing their own lives. Going beyond the irrigation we are also advising them to do double cropping that is on the CAADP production pillar, because that can change their lives. Even farmers who are not irrigating are starting to do that on our advice.&rdquo; &nbsp;<em>&ldquo;So before the training, would you have stopped with the irrigation, but not raised farmers consciousness or discussed with them about double cropping?&rdquo;</em>&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, that is right.&rdquo;&nbsp; <em>&ldquo;Now, how many times in a week are you out in the field talking to farmers?&rdquo; </em>&nbsp;&ldquo;In a week almost 50% of the time we are out there in the field. Before the training I was out in the field maybe 10% or 20% of the time. It [the training] has changed my perception.&rdquo;&nbsp; <cite>Tanzania R11 sub-national government</cite></blockquote>
                           <h3><strong>Personal Empowerment and Courage</strong></h3>
                           <p>The words &ldquo;empowerment&rdquo; and &ldquo;courage&rdquo; were used by many Champions to describe how Africa Lead training has influenced them. Champions describe new drive to push beyond old boundaries, change how they do business, and speak out in ways they would not have done before. Closely linked were words like &lsquo;energized,&rsquo; &lsquo;fired-up&rsquo; or &lsquo;gingered-up&rsquo; to describe a new sense of purpose to engage with work related to their missions as Champions for Food Security.</p>
                           <p>Africa Lead cut through urban alienation towards rural people and empowered professionals by helping them see that their actions can make a difference to an issue of vital concern to their countries and to Africa. It also empowered people, especially women, working in semi-formal roles in food value chains by helping them realize that farming and food related businesses are important to the development of their countries. </p>
                           <p>One of the strongest descriptions of empowerment came from a Ugandan. Although his grandparents were rural people and his grandmother was a farmer, he grew up in a city where he went to the university. Even though he dealt with agriculture professionally, his focus was on his professional concerns, not on using his skills to have a positive impact on the lives of rural people. Africa Lead shifted his life&rsquo;s purpose by infusing him with a profound sense of social responsibility.</p>
                           <blockquote style="width:auto">&ldquo;The training was an eye-opener in many ways, because being a professional does not mean you are empowered. I&rsquo;ve been reporting agriculture for close to nine years now and the whole time my challenge was all about writing, picking stories to write about. I never thought to say to myself&nbsp; &lsquo;I can change people through this mechanism.&rsquo;&nbsp; Having social responsibility to change the situation is something that many of us lack; we get stuck to our professions. That was its [Africa Lead&rsquo;s] biggest achievement; something that came out very broadly -- that we can be empowered to do better than what we are now; that we can move what we are doing down to the people, we can make sure that the people benefit from it. Before it was just business as usual. Now it&rsquo;s no longer just business, it&rsquo;s a passion.&rdquo; <cite>Uganda R10 media</cite></blockquote>
                           <p>Along with social responsibility Champions expressed new confidence or faith that relatively ordinary people like themselves can make a difference. They don&rsquo;t need to wait for an authority figure, program or donor for permission to act. </p>
                           <blockquote style="width:auto">&ldquo;I think what I can say was very clear to me, which I can say I took home [from the training] was the drive, or spirit to move things. The spirit that yes, we can make it!&nbsp; We don&rsquo;t need to wait for somebody else to make it. In our own way, we each one of us can make it.&rdquo; <cite>Kenya R4 NGO</cite></blockquote>
                           <p>Closely connected to feeling empowered to act, is feeling empowered to speak out to authority. Champions in very different contexts in Tanzania and Ghana described how the training gave them courage to engage with authority figures. </p>
                           <p>&ldquo;What I can say briefly is that the training itself was quite inspirational. I learnt a lot of things, but in particular, it build my confidence to engage with the different levels of authority when it comes to promoting agriculture in my country and in the region.&rdquo;&nbsp; (Tanzania R1 regional org)</p>
                           <p>The Champions from northern Ghana expressed frustration that information about development opportunities, and hence development resources, always seem to go to the same NGOS and their associated communities and farmer networks, leaving others out. Before the training he had no idea or role model for how to reach out to resource gatekeepers, but the training gave him courage to demand information.</p>
                           <p>&ldquo;A lot of farmers who aren&rsquo;t part of these networks are being sidelined. So one of the things Africa Lead did was help people who are outside push themselves inside, because after the training we raised these issues. The way I was telling you, in the training we were free to talk. That gave us the courage that nobody is going to take us to court for saying these things. So we really said what was worrying us, and our capacity to fight it was built. That is the achievement [of Africa Lead] that I just stated. I can speak freely and safely in front of them. Now I am bold to go to offices [of the Ministry of Food and Agriculture] to ask them for information about what they do, to tell them about what I do and to ask them for information.&rdquo; (Ghana R11 NGO)</p>
                           <p>In addition to modern professionals, several Africa Lead workshops included men and women, but especially women, without formal education but with important private sector roles as buyer/bulker/traders, seed grower and distributers, input suppliers, processors or other. The training empowered them by helping them realize they are important to Africa&rsquo;s development.</p>
                           <p>The example quoted here is of a semi-literate woman, also a traditional chief, who is a second or third generation processor/trader in a small city. Both her children are studying at university. Prior to Africa Lead, neither planed to return help her with the family business, but since the training they have changed their minds; now both plan to come home to help her transform the family business into a modern enterprise.</p>
                           <p>&ldquo;Africa Lead has given me a lot of skills. It boosted my morale. It made me know that what I am doing is important, very important. And that really gave me strength. It has boosted my morale.&rdquo;&nbsp; (Ghana R13 private sector)</p>
                           <p>This Champion has not stopped with her own empowerment, she is spreading the word to the women in the 32 women farmer groups that look to her for leadership.</p>
                           <p>&ldquo;The impact I have, I have impacted it on my ladies, and they are excited. They are very happy, because some of them were lagging behind in what we were doing. But I made them know that if you do not have the courage yourself, then you cannot go forward. And it is through Africa Lead I got to know that. I have let them know that they have to believe in themselves before someone will also believe in them. I have told them that you are important, because you are a person who is key in the food system. So you matter a lot to the people of Ghana. It was through Africa Lead I saw that.&rdquo; (Ghana R13 private sector)</p>
                           <p>In addition to specific dimensions of empowerment, there is evidence from the interviews that their identity as Champions for Food Security is a source of motivation for some who went through the trainings. The ideals of activism and social responsibility instilled in participants during the workshops become embodied in their self-identification as a &ldquo;Champions for Food Security&rdquo; after the training ends. The label signifies the unique experience they have been through, creates a cohort consciousness, and reminds Champions that they are activists for food security in their countries and in Africa.</p>
                           <p>A Kenyan Champion was explicit about the power and purpose her identity as a Champion for Food Security gives her.</p>
                           <p>&ldquo;The other achievement which I got [from Africa Lead] is that it gave me position as a person. I feel confident that I am one of the Champions who can champion food security in Africa, starting with Kenya. What I&rsquo;m talking about is me, as a person. After the training I got strengthened. I feel I am one of the Champions within Africa, and I must use the information and knowledge to change food security within Africa, starting with Kenya.&rdquo;&nbsp; (Kenya R2 consultant)</p>
                           <p>In Ghana, another Champion, who has gone through considerable personal sacrifice since the training, gave moving testimony about how the activist ideals embodied in the concept of Champion continue to inspire and challenge him every day.</p>
                           <p>&ldquo;They gave me a glass figurine, on which they wrote &ldquo;Champion.&rdquo; I brought it and put it on my table in the office. That [the glass figurine] says &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a Champion.&rdquo; Am I a Champion?&nbsp; What makes me a Champion? &nbsp;How can I exhibit that I&rsquo;m a Champion?&nbsp; These are things that make me not forget.&rdquo; (Ghana R12 NGO)</p>
                           <p>The same Ugandan who spoke about social responsibility described the how the power of the Champion identity came into play at meeting he attended in Swaziland.</p>
                           <p>&ldquo;There is pride in being a Champion. I was in Swaziland last year at a meeting and I stood up to introduce myself. &lsquo;I am [XXXX]. I work with [YYYY] in Uganda and I am a Champion for Change trained and certified by USAID Africa Lead program.&rsquo; &nbsp;I wondered if there were other Champions [at the meeting] and it was overwhelming, how many Champions stood up from all types of countries. In Uganda when you are moving around you see Champions greeting each other: &lsquo;Hi Champion [XXXX]!&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Hi Champion [YYYY]!&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; (Uganda R10 media)</p>
                           <p>Midway through the Lessons Learned research process a probe question was added to interviews that asked about shifts in energy Champions felt in the days right after the training, and to see if their experiences of heightened energy dropped, stayed the same, or increased over the 12 to 18 months that had elapsed between Module One trainings and the Lessons Learned interviews. A surprisingly large number of Champions reported that their personal drive and commitment as food security Champions has actually grown stronger over the 12 to 18 months since the training ended, implying that a virtuous cycle of empowerment-to-action-to-empowerment was triggered in some of them. This following section quoted from an interview with a Ghanaian Champion gives some sense of how this works.</p>
                           <p><em>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been over a year and that energy was a certain level when you came out of training.&rdquo;</em>&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, fresh.&rdquo;&nbsp; <em>&ldquo;Since then, what is happening to that energy?&rdquo;</em>&nbsp; &ldquo;I think its going up every day; I will say the energy hasn&rsquo;t faded. Yes, the energy has been on in my work since then, and also personally trying to look for other ways to develop. You see, after the training you set out to achieve what you said, and as you are moving to try to achieve it, you also develop as an individual. And that goes back and makes the impact on your work more.&rdquo; (Ghana R2 research)</p>

                           <strong>How Champions applied Africa Lead trainings in their work</strong>
                           <p>This section of the report describes some of the ways Champions applied new knowledge and skills gained through Africa Lead to their work and lives by describing illustrative examples from the Lessons Learned interviews. After the trainings, Champions made a wide range of changes in their behaviors and engaged in new actions and initiatives inspired by Africa Lead. As a generalization, the scope and nature of changes made or actions taken depended on the resources at the Champion&rsquo;s disposal, the position they occupied relative to larger organizations and networks, and food security issues they were grappling with.</p>
                           <p>Actions ranged from the highly personal to changes in departments, organizations, associations or networks, to actions with potential to impact ways stakeholders interact moving agriculture development forward. The stories that follow give examples of changes at the individual, organizational, and systems levels. They do not reflect all, or even necessarily the most spectacular stories, but they give a flavor of the kinds of things Champions have done, which Champions themselves credit to their experience of the Africa Lead trainings.</p>
                           <h3>Individual Actions</h3>
                           <p>Integrated Extension and Value Chain Upgrading. Champions working in extension roles with farmers have spent more time with clients and also incorporated new elements into their extension work inspired by the CAADP framework. One example is the Tanzanian irrigation specialist who started to teach farmers about double cropping, even though it lies outside of his scope as an irrigation engineer. Another example is from Uganda and involves a young NGO program director responsible for a maize production and marketing program. Before the training he thought of his work strictly in terms of helping farmers increase yields and get better market access. After the training he realized poor nutrition is a critical issue in the communities, so on his own initiative he partnered with another Africa Lead Champion from the same part of Uganda, who knows about nutrition. Together they developed a training module on nutrition that he has incorporated into his extension work with grain farmers.</p>
                           <p>The same Ugandan NGO program director had attended a workshop on warehouse receipt systems a few months before he took Africa Lead&rsquo;s Module One training, but did not act on anything he learned until after he became a Champion. Based on the first workshop, warehouse receipts had seemed remote and abstract. But Africa Lead&rsquo;s training made it come alive for him. The training also connected him to Champions working on warehouse receipts and regional grain trade, with whom he has stayed in touch. By the time this Champion was interviewed for Lessons Learned he had been actively promoting warehouse receipt systems with farmers in his district for over a year. Some of the farmer groups had set up structures and systems; he was also working with buyers. He is passionate about developing grain value chains and wants more training to develop his expertise and skills in grain warehousing and regional trade.</p>
                           <p>Volunteer Extension. In Liberia, two Champions from the NGO sector, who knew nothing about food security prior to the trainings, both have begun to speak about these topics with farmers and local communities after their experience with Africa Lead. One of them, a woman with an NGO focused on natural resource management (NRM), had been working with rural women&rsquo;s groups for years without ever thinking about struggles they face every day trying to ensure enough food for their families. Once she started talking with them about it, a whole new way of viewing the world and her mission opened up for her. She still saw the NRM agenda as important, but she also began to see it as siloed. She was ashamed she had been blind to the core struggle in these women&rsquo;s lives for so long. She longs to learn more about agriculture and food security so she can be more effective in her work with rural women. The other Liberian Champion returned to his natal community after the training in order to bring some of the knowledge he&rsquo;d learned back to them. Extension is limited in Liberia and local communities are hungry for information on agriculture. The Champion&rsquo;s community now turns to him for information, and although he does the best he can, he also longs for more training so he can serve them better.</p>
                           <p>Replication of Task One Pedagogy. Several Champions have applied methods from Africa Lead in their own work with beneficiaries or clients. For example, a Champion from Ghana was developing a training program for SMEs. His objective was to implement it across Ghana, but he did not like the didactic pedagogy used in most trainings, so he had not moved ahead with the project. The pedagogical approach and elements used by Africa Lead radically altered his vision of the possible.&nbsp; This is especially true with the group exercises and games which this Champion believes help people grasp what is being taught in simple, straight-forward ways to which they can relate. He put many of the techniques he learned from Africa Lead into his SME training and went on to implement it with great success. This Champion believes most capacity building given in Africa is based on didactic methods to which people cannot relate, so even though a lot of time and donor money is spent on &ldquo;talk shops,&rdquo; nothing ever changes. He believes the pedagogy piloted by Africa Lead could revolutionize the way capacity building is conducted in Africa.</p>
                           <p>Cascade Trainings. Champions from farmer-based organizations have replicated Module One in &ldquo;cascade trainings&rdquo; with their farmer members. For example, in Ghana, the leader of a women&rsquo;s farmer network developed a strategy to sensitize all her members on the content of Module One, including CAADP, by adding discussions to activities funded by other donors.</p>
                           <p>Tipping Points. Several Champions&rsquo; narratives revolved around motifs of risk taking. Their experience with Africa Lead empowered them to make changes in their professional lives they would not have made before the training. For example, a Champion in Kenya was founder and head of a well-known and securely funded regional network to promote environmentally sustainable agriculture. During the training he became increasingly convinced of the need to work holistically with the whole range of issues facing small holder farmers. &ldquo;I realized it is not just conservation agriculture that can make us food secure, there are a lot of other things to it: market linkages, value addition, agro-processing, policy articulation; these are all related.&rdquo;&nbsp; He realized his vision was &ldquo;much broader than just one technology.&rdquo;&nbsp; So he left his position as director of the established network to lead a new NGO more in line with his vision of providing integrated support to farmers. &ldquo;It was a tough decision, to come out of comfort to a place where we didn&rsquo;t even have structures or stable funding.&rdquo;&nbsp; (Kenya R4 NGO)</p>
                           <p>Making Development AID More Effective. Several Champions leveraged their experience with Africa Lead to make donor funded approaches more effective and sustainable. A Kenyan Champion, who is an expert on cooperatives and value chains, heads a company that provides capacity building on value chain methodologies. Prior to Africa Lead, most of their workshops catered to single groups (for example farmers or input dealers), or else were filled ad hoc, as any business course would be. This Champion&rsquo;s experience with Africa Lead led to an important paradigm shift in how she conceived of using her company&rsquo;s skills with value chain analysis. Prior to the training she had not used stakeholder analysis to <em>proactively</em> set up regional workshops with single commodity focus. Now her company uses stakeholder analysis to identify key players across the length of a single commodity value chain to bring them together for intense one to two week value chain mapping and planning workshops. Between 2011 and 2012, her company organized 12 commodity-based value chain stakeholder workshops that brought key players together for the first time. The energy and excitement in the workshops is intense. As participants begin to realize that together, they have the ability and power to radically transform and upgrade their value chains.

                           <p>Reaching Beyond Personal Limits. Other stories are of Champions who reach beyond personal limits in remarkable ways in response to the trainings. Among similar cases of remarkable Champions, one concerns a woman from Liberia with high school education. Together with her parents she had grown rice and beans all her life, using traditional methods. Known for her remarkable skill as a farmer, she was selected in 2009 to participate in a donor program on rice seed production. Just before the Africa Lead training in Accra, she and three employees were growing seed on 0.5 hectares, which she sold to NGOs and FAO (U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization).</p>
                           <p>She changed her life completely after the training in Accra. Working closely with other Champions, she helped established a farmer-based organization in Liberia. She also recruited and organized 500 farmers into an association and began giving them rice seed, teaching them how to grow it on her own farm, and following up with extension visits to their farms.</p>
                           <p>She expanded her own seed production from 0.5 to 10 hectares, and went from three to fifty employees. She is saving to finance a rice mill and packaging equipment, and has identified land and started brick production for a rice storage building. When these are in place she plans to aggregate, process, package and market rice grown by members of her farmers association.</p>
                           <p>One of the things Africa Lead taught her was how to communicate and manage people. This has made a difference in her capacity to bring people on board with her vision. This Champion has no external salary, funds or loans; she is building her business one step at a time by plowing back profits from her harvests. She is a well-known farm leader, constantly moving from place to place to provide technical and moral support.</p>
                           <p>&ldquo;Being a leader now, they give me a hard time because they expect me to do everything for them. So I have to teach them how to do business. What I sow in the soil is what I take and sow back again. Nobody is helping me, so in this way I motivate them to keep going.&rdquo;&nbsp; (Liberia R5 farmer)</p>
                           <p>When asked how she sustained her energy with so many farmers turning to her for leadership, she contrasted herself before and after her experience with Africa Lead.</p>
                           <p>&ldquo;From Accra I grabbed a vision that we shouldn&rsquo;t just come home and sit on it. You have to come home and do something, so others will say &lsquo;Yes, she is up to this level&rsquo; [of being a Champion]. When I was working [before Africa Lead] I was selfish in working. But when I came back from Ghana I just decided, I have got seed in my warehouse right now. Some farmers don&rsquo;t have seed to plant. So I gave it to them.&rdquo;&nbsp; &hellip; and that is how it started. (Liberia R5 farmer)</p>
                           <h3>Actions Impacting Organizations</h3>
                           <p>The impact the Africa Lead experience has had on Champions is also evidenced beyond the level of individual to shifts in practice at the institutional level. Empowered by the leadership skills and motivated by the sense of urgency gained from the training, some Champions have embedded new management and operational styles in their home organizations. In particular they have instituted regular team meetings with staff, solicited staff input on strategic directions or decisions, and empowered staff to try new ideas. In other cases, Champions&rsquo; organizations themselves have added priorities and adopted new mandates. Champions who were part of top leadership circles within their organizations, especially when several were trained from the same organization, were able to make high impact changes across their entire organization or network. In contrast, Champions in mid-level (or lower) positions were limited to making smaller more incremental changes in ways they supervise their own staff.</p>
                           <p>Most Champions from government agencies were mid-level civil servants, while Champions from other sectors were often leaders or senior managers of NGOs, businesses, networks, associations or research organizations. As a result, impacts of Africa Lead trainings at the organizational level were negligible on large public sector institutions, but could be quite significant on organizations from other sectors. Some ways the trainings impacted non-state organizations through the new empowerment of their leaders are illustrated with examples from Ghana and East Africa.</p>
                           <p>New Management and Operational Styles. Most of the national leadership of a farmer-based organization (FBO) in Ghana attended Module One trainings between January and June 2011. Afterwards they sat down together and agreed &ldquo;that the training given to us, if taken seriously, will help move our organization forward; so let us start practicing it now.&rdquo;&nbsp; They identified needs for more openness and transparency among themselves, more sharing of information throughout the organization, and greater willingness to delegate power.</p>
                           <p>Before the training there were no regular membership meetings, the president was the only person authorized to sign checks on the FBO&rsquo;s account. He personally spoke for and represented the FBO at events all over Ghana. After the training, check-signing authority was expanded to seven people, transparency protocols around use of FBO funds were established, and the president began empowering members of the board. The national leadership started to convene regular membership meetings four times a year and began to share information and delegate authority to regional and district levels of the organization.</p>
                           <p>&ldquo;We used not to meet regularly. But after the training, we agreed that even when we don&rsquo;t have funds to call for meetings, so that those who are committed can participate. And I have been surprised; almost everybody comes. People&rsquo;s commitment is deeper that we realized. Now, we don&rsquo;t have members complaining &lsquo;we don&rsquo;t know of this issue, we don&rsquo;t know of this program, we don&rsquo;t know of these policies&rsquo; because of the delegation of duties. Now, when there is a national issue, the regional focal person in each region disseminates the information to the district and community mobilization officers, they also get the information to the grassroots, and it makes the work very easy&hellip; And these days, when we are meeting as a board, a different person from the board chairs the meeting each time, with my support, and so that&rsquo;s another change. Now, in my absence, a board meeting can still go on, but it used not to be so, because everyone was insisting that the president must be there. After this training [Africa Lead] I told them, &ldquo;If the president drops dead, what happens to the organization?&rdquo; &nbsp;It must continue. Let us stop this kind of bureaucracy and look at the importance of the organization, because a lot of people benefit from what we do, so we need to continue. It doesn&rsquo;t mean that if one person is not there, it should not go on. It must continue.&rdquo;&nbsp; (Ghana, R14 FBO)</p>
                           <p>The shifts in leadership described by this Champion have lead to a spread of empowerment throughout the organization. Now, the FBO president encourages regional and district officers to engage directly in advocacy on issues, whereas before he was the only person who spoke for the organization.</p>
                           <p><em>&ldquo;As a result of the increased culture of transparency and openness, and willingness to delegate power, are you communicating more freely?&rdquo;</em> &ldquo;Much more freely. Even when somebody asks a big question, about a big issue, I tell them to contact A,B or C, so they know the information is all over, its not just within me. Yesterday I listened to the news and I was surprised to hear one of my officers talking about fertilizer subsidy in one of the districts. So I sent him a text telling him to keep the momentum, keep the flame burning. I want to hear from different sources, to tell the whole country we are a national association, it is not just one person who is doing it, a lot of people are doing it. That is the only way we can move ahead.&rdquo;&nbsp; (Ghana R14 FBO)</p>
                           <p>New Business Practices. Because of the new concept of a leader as someone who empowers their followers, a Champion who owns a food processing business radically altered the way she treats and works with her staff, leading to expansion of her business. Before the training she was the only one in sales, because she did not trust her workers with the products. But after the training she enlisted them all as sales representatives based on commissions and it has caused a surge in her business&rsquo;s volume.</p>
                           <p><em>&ldquo;Did the training influence the way you run your business?&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, because I used to have workers, but I didn&rsquo;t let them go out with my product to sell, I was scared. But after [the training] I saw the need for allowing them. Before the person goes out I give them the product that maybe will cost up to his salary and I tell the person if you are able to sell this, your commission is this. So besides the salary the person has commission. And it was through the [Africa Lead] workshop that I was able to do all of this.&rdquo; &ldquo;<em>Has it motivated them?</em>&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;It has. They are motivated and excited. They are selling more and my business is expanding. And that is because of the change in my attitude. Because I have changed, I have changed some of them as well. I have made them know the reason why we should come together, because if you are not together, you cannot share ideas&hellip; You have to share ideas. You have to tell what you are doing, and ask what they feel about what you are doing, and ask what they think they also want to do, so it makes you grow every day.&rdquo;&nbsp; (Ghana R13 private sector)</p>
                           <p>New Priorities and Mandates. In East Africa, the leadership effect has also influenced the direction of the work of organizations. ASARECA sent several of its senior staff and top leadership to Africa Lead trainings. Afterwards the staff spent time together examining what being Champions for Food Security meant for their institutional mandate. This led to re-examining uses of the wealth of data ASARECA houses toward informing larger public policy development. The Association, founded in 1994, covers 11 countries, the newest being South Sudan. Having already shifted from a crop-specific orientation to the more holistic value chain approach, ASARECA is leveraging its work with universities, national agricultural research organizations, and more recently with NGOs toward using its data more proactively for policy reform. Through such innovations as hosting <strong>media</strong> breakfasts ASARECA is stimulating more awareness among reporters and editors about food security issues and actions. This, in turn, is informing a public discourse on these issues and pressing policymakers to respond to specific opportunities to improve farmer access to agricultural finance, re-examining &ldquo;orphan crops&rdquo; for their nutritional value, expanding business development through converting unsold fresh fruit to dried products, and the like.

                           <h3>Actions with Potential to Impact Wider Systems</h3>
                           <p>In both East and West Africa, Champions have sparked follow-on activity that is advancing capacity to improve food security <em>systemically </em>through impacts on national value chains, media awareness, or on regional level value chain coordination<em>. </em>The following studies illustrate ways in which Africa Lead&rsquo;s transformative leadership and management training inspired groups of Champions in positions to effect this type of broad scale change.</p>
                           <p>National Value Chains. In Ghana the 3,000 plus member National Association of Poultry Farmers (NAPF) completely shifted its approach to advocacy as a result of the training. Prior to Africa Lead, NAPF had applied to the Business Sector Advocacy Challenge Fund (BUSAC) for help with a campaign to engage the government on issues affecting the poultry sector, but BUSAC turned them down. After attending Africa Lead, NAPF Champions convinced their executive director to submit a new proposal to BUSAC based on Kotter&rsquo;s 8 points for &ldquo;creating awareness, creating urgency, forming the working team and etc.&rdquo;&nbsp; BUSAC approved the new proposal, because &ldquo;we had a better strategy, based on what we&rsquo;d learned.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
                           <p>With assistance from BUSAC, NAPF began a campaign that included three critical innovations inspired by Africa Lead. For the first time, NAPF used mass media to raise public awareness and build urgency around the need to support a national poultry sector. They conducted policy research and analysis <em>before</em> approaching lobbying targets. They also conducted stakeholder analysis to identify key lobbying targets <em>across</em> <em>all </em>of government, as well as in other sectors.</p>
                           <p>By August 2012 NAPF&rsquo;s campaign had resulted in a signed MOU with the National Buffer Stock Corporation to distribute subsidized maize to poultry farmers for the first time, and a major contract with Liberty Commodity (a private sector investor group) to provide broilers and eggs to a new national chain of poultry retail outlets. At the same time, NAPF and BUSAC were preparing a second campaign on the ECOWAS Common Tariff and on government egg purchase for Ghana&rsquo;s school lunch program. Africa Lead helped NAPF turn a corner in its approach to advocacy and communication that was critical to its successes, especially with government.</p>
                           <p>&ldquo;Before [the training] we were very abrasive with government. So [after the training] we went on to win-win messages, and government gave us a listening. Before we were face-to-face with government, face-to-face with the ministry (MOFA), but this time around we used the media. We changed the messages, we changed the approach, we even changed the medium.&rdquo; (Ghana R10 FBO)</p>
                           <p>Although content on Kotter&rsquo;s 8 Steps was a key factor in the impact Africa Lead had on NAPF, it was not the only one. The relationships NAPF formed with other Champions also contributed to the success of the campaign by opening new channels of communication between non-state actors and government<em>. </em>So even though Champions from the public sector did not impact their organizations as much as non-state actors did, their inclusion in Champions&rsquo; networks was also a critical factor in NAPF&rsquo;s new &ldquo;win-win&rdquo; approach to government advocacy.</p>
                           <p><em>&ldquo;Have the relationships you formed with Champions through the trainings been relevant to the success of the advocacy campaign?&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;It is relevant because we know exactly what is happening in the various departments and ministries. We are able to know who to contact and we have a common bond with them, a common approach [based on fact that they are all Champions].&nbsp; And it has facilitated dialogue with those who are higher [government officials with power to change policy] because we know who they are before we get there, through this [Africa Lead Champions] networking. We know the nature of that person, their characteristics, how they will behave, and whether the person will accept the message that we will bring, all because of the [Africa Lead Champion] networking. You see, because at each of these Champions trainings you meet people from different ministries, agencies and industries.&rdquo; (Ghana R10 FBO)</p>
                           <p>Regional Initiatives. Several Champions affiliated with the East African Grain Council (EAGC) are putting thought to deed as a result of the actual &ldquo;action plans&rdquo; inspired by the training. One such innovative device is the creation of a <strong>regional food balance sheet</strong>. Described as akin to an accounting balance, this snapshot of food surpluses, deficits and distribution provides all actors, public and private, in the agricultural sector the same data consolidated in one place. By analyzing the surpluses and gaps in available food across the region, these different critical players can both plan policy and trade more efficiently and effectively.</p>
                           <p>&ldquo;&hellip; our problem statement was that a lot of the times we are groping in darkness on what we have available and we do not plan adequately because we do not know what food we have. A lot of food is going to waste because there are so many surplus areas in the region that are not directly linked to the deficit areas. And we looked at it in terms of saying that we can actually improve that situation by actually linking these two through regional trade. But before you can do that we need to have that information where policymakers, traders are involved in moving goods at a profit exactly know where the need is, where they can source from and how do they link. And when you begin to do that a lot of other dynamics come into play. You need to work with policy guides. You need to work with cross-border officials who are supposed to enable rather than hinder regional trade so we set out to do that.&rdquo; &nbsp;(Kenya R3 regional organization)</p>
                           <p>In a set of steps the Champions directly attribute to the training, the EAGC set up national&nbsp;consultative multi-stakeholder groups of farmers, millers, traders, and government personnel. These bodies are now standing committees under the auspices of the East Africa Community.</p>
                           <p>&ldquo;For the very first time we ended up with a regional food balance sheet in September of 2011 at a meeting that we held in Arusha. And at this meeting we brought in together all those standing committees from all the five partner states to aggregate the national&nbsp;food balance sheet at the regional level. Now since that time the EAC took it up and the sectorial council in food security recommended that we needed to expand that program and create a comprehensive food balance sheet that was not just based on cereals and grains like that [that] caters to the regional diet, at it were. So in May this year EAC did organize a meeting and we supported it together with EAC and we supported it together with USAID COMPETE to put together a regional framework for a comprehensive regional food balance sheet.&rdquo; (Kenya R3 regional organization)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
                           <p>This pilot phase has been further institutionalized with the design and hosting of an easy to navigate Internet-based food portal: <a href="http://www.rfbs.in/" target="_blank">WWW.RFBS.IN</a>. Along with guest access, the site also provides password-protected data submission and sharing. This feature has helped to quell fears of private sector partners who seek to protect their comparative advantage in the marketplace. They can share their data without revealing who has what stock or is in need of any given commodity.</p>
                           <p>Food supply information aggregated at the regional level is an innovation that has great potential for promoting efficiencies in the production and trade of staple commodities. Acting on this knowledge can even out market gaps and bulges to more evenly distribute food to consumers and stabilize the income of producers, processors and traders.&nbsp;</p>

                           <h1>Part Four<br />
                              Recommendations for Africa Lead
                           </h1>
                           <p>The final section of the <em>Africa Lead Lessons Learned Main Sythesis Report</em> presents recommendations suggested by the Champions on how to build on the the 2010-2013 Africa Lead program in subsequent USAID programs going forward, as well as their recommendations for advancing CAADP overall.</p>
                           <p>These recommendations represent a constellation of thoughtful and practical applications for applying Africa Lead trainings and their associated benefits. The Summary that follows the Recommendations highlights the broad outline of how these steps help advance the ultimate goal of Africans improving food security for Africans.</p>
                           <p>During key informant interviews, Champions discussed ideas to improve Africa Lead moving foreward, including practical suggestions on how to target leadership training to maximize wider impacts on food security in their countries. There were also animated discussions and recommendations for post-training follow up for Champions who have been trained, as well as discussions of capacity building, knowledge sharing and policy development. Some of these insights reflect actions USAID can undertake. Others respond more directly to implementing the CAADP framework more instrumentally.</p>
                           <p>These recommendations fall into three groups, those directed at bilateral Missions in particular, those directed at both bilateral and regional missions, and those aimed more direclty at realizing CAADP&rsquo;s goals.</p>
                           <p>Recommendations for bilateral Missions</p>
                           <p>Three recommendations fall under the scope of USAID bilateral Missions, since they need to be crafted to fit the specific contexts prevailing in each country.</p>

                           <p><strong>RECOMMENDATIONS IN GENERAL</strong></p>
                           <p>&clubs; Hold Ministries of Agriculture and other key players, <em>including donors, </em>accountable based on CAADP framework, principles and their own analyses by empowering farmers and their communities.</p>
                           <strong>Recommendations for bilateral Missions</strong>
                           <h3>1) Improve follow up with Champions Post-Training</h3>
                           <p>Champions in all countries expressed frustration at the lack of substantive thinking about how to follow up with fellow Champions after leadership trainings ended. Africa Lead workshops are important and have profound impacts, but Champions also need to be supported post-training if they are to reach their potential <em>as networks of likeminded and committed leaders driving change in their national food systems.</em></p>
                           <p>During key informant interviews, Champions were questioned about their contact with other Champions after the trainings. Findings suggest that Champions who attended the same workshop and who also share work interests, or come from the same small area, or share other networks (such as church) tend to stay in touch. But there was no systematic way for Champions to meet, share lessons, or stay connected to the whole network from their country. This Champions see as a missed opportunity to learn from, encourage, help and inspire each other. This also impedes transfer of learning from their experiences to USAID or to CAADP working groups in Ministries of Agriculture.</p>
                           <p>The same criticism came from bilateral Missions. Those interviewed feel that Africa Lead does not have an adequate process in place for linking them to the Champions from their countries. Some of the Mission points of contact note that even if Africa Lead gives them a list of names, there is still need for a formal &ldquo;hand-over&rdquo; process so that contact can be initiated with Champions in ways that are transparent and inclusive of the whole network.</p>
                           <p>Some bilateral Missions are also frustrated because members of their own (African) staffs working on Feed the Future programs were not allowed to attend Module One Leadership trainings, even though they had supplied names for the workshops. In retrospect, not allowing Mission staff to attend Module One trainings was a missed opportunity to build their understanding of the methodology and its relevance for bilateral Mission programs under Feed the Future.</p>
                           <p>During Task One workshops, Africa Lead encouraged Champions to stay connected with each other after the training. Efforts were made to provide them with lists and contact information of Champions from the same country who were in different workshops between January and June 2011. Champions were also asked to respond to an online survey six months after their training. From time to time, Africa Lead&rsquo;s regional offices send out notices to Champions via email. On a few occassions, Africa Lead&rsquo;s COP and DCOPs have invited groups of Champions for meetings, which is also a chance to gather their feedback.</p>
                           <p>The problems with these efforts are that they are ad hoc, and they depend on Africa Lead&rsquo;s M&amp;E staff, who have other responsibilities. They also rely on email lists to contact Champions, as opposed to mobile phone or written letter. Since a significant minority of the Champions do not use email, they lost touch with the program after the training.</p>
                           <p>The Africa Lead program maintains a Facebook page for Champions, but few of those interviewed look at it, partly because of difficulty accessing the Internet. But also because only the youngest Champions in the sample (under the age of 30) are comfortable using social media. Most of the Champions over the age of 30 or 35 associate social media with frivolous social activities. They said they rarely, if ever, visit Africa Lead&rsquo;s Facebook page, even if they do have Internet access. Furthermore, the Facebook page and emails from Africa Lead&rsquo;s project offices will stop when Africa Lead ends, and unless something else is there to sustain the networks, even this limited connectivity will dissipate.</p>
                           <p>Champions have come up with ideas for Africa Lead to support same country Champions networks more effectively:</p>
                           <p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sponsor annual Champions meetings for same-country Champions;</p>
                           <p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Provide modest support required to maintain the national Champions network; and</p>
                           <p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Establish a process for same-country Champions to decide whether they want to establish a formal network or association.</p>
                           <p><strong>Specific Recommendations</strong></p>
                           <p>&clubs; Hold National Champions Meetings</p>
                           <p>Africa Lead should work with bilateral Missions to organize 2-day Champions Meetings in countries with 100 or more Champions to formally introduce Champions to USAID bilateral Missions and to national ministries. The entire cohort needs to be invited using phone and written letter, as well as email.</p>
                           <p>Among other things, meetings would provide a venue for same country Champions to network, share lessons learned from their work, share resources, and identify mentors to help them with their post-training efforts to put the trainings into practice. Africa Lead could work with Missions to establish a schedule of Champions meetings (for example, annually), so that the meetings function as a capstone event to formally introduce newly-minted Champion cohorts to each other and to USAID, government agencies, and veteran Champions.</p>
                           <p>There would need to be modest investment by Africa Lead to support someone to maintain the network between annual meetings. Liberian Champions, especially, feel very strongly about the need for a National Champions&rsquo; Meeting organized and sponsored by USAID. But it would also be useful in other countries with large numbers of Champions.</p>
                           <p>&clubs; Support Champions with a Process to Decide If They Want to Establish A Formal Champions&rsquo; Network in Their Country</p>
                           <p>Champions from Kenya are passionate about the need to formalize the Kenyan Champions network to give them legitimacy interacting with the government on food sector reform. There was considerable debate over whether this would be redundant with CAADP&rsquo;s roadmap for Non-State Actor platforms. The Champions who recommend this are sophisticated individuals, many with deep understanding of the Kenyan polical economy. They argue that precisely <em>because</em> Champions come from all sectors and transcend politics, they are in a unique position to support the CAADP process in Kenya. This is especially true for facilitation of dialogue among the non-state actor platforms (which are organized by sector) and between non-state actors and the government. They feel that Champions would benefit Kenya by acting as an independent &ldquo;Think-Tank&rdquo; for the government.</p>
                           <p>Ugandan Champions are also passionate about formalizing the Champions&rsquo; network in Uganda. They feel a formal network is needed to amplify and sustain positive energy, more open communication, and innovation flowing from the transformative leadership trainings in Uganda. Ugandan Champions want to grow a &ldquo;Champions for Food Security&rdquo; movement in the country. They want to ensure it is sustainable, and eventually independent of donor funding. They believe that establishing a formal Champions&rsquo; network or association is the first step in this process.</p>
                           <p>Champions in other countries are not thinking about forming formal networks, like they are in Kenya and Uganda. Except for Tanzania, it did not come up in other interviews. But Tanzanian Champions feel that there are advantages to maintaining an informal network of Champions that could be managed by an existing civil society network or policy dialogue working group.</p>
                           <p>Given differences in each country&rsquo;s context, decisions whether to support formation of a formal Champions&rsquo; network or association need to be made on a country-by-country basis. Champions in both Kenya and Uganda urge USAID Missions to put the question to the Champions themselves at a National Meeting of the kind recommended above. Champions could then vote on whether or not to form a formal network or association, and also on how to organize and fund it. Champions in Kenya and Uganda emphasize that USAID needs to support the process at the beginning, including financing the first two or three meetings, in order to confer legitimacy to the process and outcome.</p>
                           <h3>2) Expand Transformative Leadership Training for Food Security At National Level</h3>
                           <p>Champions from all countries recommend applying the leadership trainings in their own countries. While the regional aspect of the trainings held in Nairobi between January &ndash; June 2011 were important to those who attended, Champions <em>also</em> think the leadership training is too important to limit in this way.</p>
                           <p>Country specifc trainings have also been transformative. The only Task One leadership trainings by country as of August 2012 were held in Uganda. Diversity was also maintained in the Ugandan workshops by mixing participants from different agencies, sectors and socio-economic statuses in each workshop, even though only Ugandans attended. Missions can act on the finding that the transformative impact of the Uganda-only workshops seems to be just as intense as that of the regional workshops held in Nairobi.</p>
                           <p><strong>Specific Recommendations</strong></p>
                           <p>&clubs; Target Leaders from Non-State Actor Organizations</p>
                           <p>Task One trainings had greater impacts on organizations when the top leadership took the trainings, as was the case with the FBOs in Ghana, or when the top leaders were already committed to the collaborative value chain approach promoted by Africa Lead, as was the case with ASARECA and to EAGC in East Africa.</p>
                           <p>&clubs; Target Those Who Hold Real Power in Public Sector Agencies</p>
                           <p>Champions in West Africa note that the people who hold real power in public sector agencies were not at the trainings, and recommend that they be targeted, in addition to mid-level civil servants. Some of the Champions observe that the willingness of this kind of entrenched, siloed leader to change would be reinforced if top elected leaders, members of the media and religious organizations also become Champions for the cause of food security.</p>
                           <p>&clubs; Target Top Level Elected Officials</p>
                           <p>Champions recommend targeting national elected leaders such as members of parliament and governors with leadership training for CAADP and Food Security. Missions in Uganda and Tanzania have implemented modified Module One trainings for Parliamentarians and other top leaders. At the request of the Kenya Ministry of Agriculture, the USAID Kenya Mission has asked Africa Lead to organize Module One trainings for all the newly elected governors about to take office from the March 2013 election cycle. Building high-level Champions will increase the impacts of Champions at all other levels in society.</p>
                           <p>&clubs; Target Sub-National Levels (region, province, district, county etc.)</p>
                           <p>In addition to targeting national leaders, Champions recommend targeting sub-national food system actors with transformative leadership training for CAADP and Food Security. This is especially indicated because decentralization means that a lot of the effective decision-making that impacts farmers takes place at sub-national levels. Including sub-national food system actors in continued Africa Lead leadership training would improve work ethics of people in local government, reduce competition among NGOs, and build trust among private sector, NGO, and government stakeholders operating in a region.</p>
                           <p>&clubs; Target Media and Religious Organizations More Systematically</p>
                           <p>National media and religious organizations could play a very important and constructive role building a broad base of urgency about food security among the public and educating the public about CAADP and about policies impacting farm incomes and national food security. Africa Lead and USAID Missions should seriously consider systematically targeting both these sectors to bring them on board as Champions for CAADP and food security.</p>
                           <h3>3) Install Africa Lead Country Program Officers in Missions with Significant<br />
                              Buy-In
                           </h3>
                           <p>A few Champions recommend having a dedicated &ldquo;Africa Lead&rdquo; program officer located in countries with large Africa Lead programs. This is actually an important recommendation since locally knowledgeable program managers could facilitate strategic targeting of organizations and individuals for training, building the cadre of leaders. This would also greatly improve the quality of post-training follow up with Champions discussed above.</p>
                           <p><strong>SPECIFIC Recommendation</strong></p>
                           <p>&clubs; Have a Dedicated Africa Lead Program Officer Located in Countries with Large Africa Lead Programs</p>
                           <strong>Recommendations for Both Bilateral and Regional USAID Missions</strong>
                           <h3>1) Build African Capacity to Implement Leadership and Management Training for CAADP and Food Security</h3>
                           <p>Champions feel that high quality, practical training courses on leadership and management are so important, and so hard to get in Africa, that Africans&rsquo; own capacity to provide this for other Africans needs to be developed in East, Southern and West Africa.</p>
                           <p><strong>SPECIFIC Recommendations</strong></p>
                           <p>&clubs; Develop a certification program for facilitators skilled with transformative pedagogical methods and with technical content related to leadership, management, CAADP and food security.</p>
                           <p>Champions recommend developing local African capacity to replicate an expanded version of Africa Lead&rsquo;s Task One training curricula.</p>
                           <p>&clubs; Develop Modules One and Two into a full multi-module curriculum.</p>
                           <p>&clubs; Strategically select local organizations to become the replicator of the methodology.</p>
                           <p>Building sustainable African ownership of the methodology and content will ensure that leadership and management training remains accessible to Africans after donor program funding ends.</p>
                           <h3>2) Use Local Institutions to Expand Access to Practical Training Opportunities</h3>
                           <p>In addition to leadership and management training, Champions want opportunities to continue building their technical skills in all aspects of agriculture and food security.</p>
                           <p>SPECIFIC Recommendations</p>
                           <p>&clubs; Proactively look for follow-on technical training opportunities for Champions.</p>
                           <p>&clubs; Leverage diverse local institutions and the Champions&rsquo; networks to create practical subject matter training.</p>
                           <p>&clubs; Expand hands-on training opportunities for other Champions.</p>
                           <p>Most educated Champions, who also interact frequently with donors, have multiple opportunities to attend technical workshops. However, Champions who are not as well educated or who do not come into contact with donors do not have many opportunities to build their practical knowledge of agriculture. Yet unless they are able to build these skills, their capacity to develop as leaders for CAADP and food security in their own local contexts will be limited.</p>
                           <h3>3) Use Blogs for Knowledge Sharing Among Champions</h3>
                           <p>Although many Champions are reluctant to use Facebook, several say they wish they had a way to share substantive content and collaborative problem solving with other Champions all over Africa.</p>
                           <p>SPECIFIC Recommendation</p>
                           <p>&clubs; Set up a dedicated blog platform for Champions that is password protected.</p>
                           <p>For those Champions with a reluctance to using social media for professional purposes, the alternative of an electronic space for posting and exchanging information has greater resonance.</p>
                           <h3>4) National and Regional Policy Reform Processes</h3>
                           <p>Africa Lead Task One trainings were very effective at improving participants&rsquo; policy and economic literacy about agriculture. The training shifted people towards understanding the systems nature of agriculture. The Champions see further potential in <em>elevating and standardizing</em> <em>knowledge</em> systematically.</p>
                           <p>SPECIFIC Recommendation</p>
                           <p>&clubs; Apply transformative methodolgy to engage national and regional policymakers on policy reform agendas.</p>
                           <p>This lesson in finding common ground can be affirmatively applied to specific policy reform processes such as regional integration of grain trading systems or in the context of specific value chains.</p>
                           <strong>Recommendations for CAADP and Food Security</strong>
                           <p>A broad consensus emerged among Champions across all ten country studies that the CAADP framework has potential to be a powerful tool in moving the agriculture agenda forward in their countries, both nationally and through regional integration. At this point, almost no one in these countries has ever heard of CAADP, even educated people. CAADP remains an esoteric subject assigned to a few technocrats in Ministries of Agriculture and perceived by the top levels in ministry/government systems as a donor-driven hoop to jump through to access funding.</p>
                           <p>According to Champions interviewed it is the CAADP framework that is critical &ndash; not any given investment plan &ndash; because the framework is an empowerment/bill of rights for the agriculture sector and for farmers.</p>
                           <p>SPECIFIC Recommendation</p>
                           <p>&clubs; Hold Ministries of Agriculture and other key players, including donors, accountable based on CAADP framework, principles and their own analyses through empowering farmers and their communities.</p>
                           <p>There is a consistent response from Champions across the country studies to questions about high pay-off strategies to realize the potential of CAADP for agriculture sector transformation at the national level. Achieving this result lies in utilizing Farmer-Based Organizations (from national apex bodies on down to the local level) to spearhead campaigns (including media campaigns) to generate widespread knowledge and understanding of CAADP among the broad base of small and medium farmers.</p>
                           <p>Once medium and small holder farmers are empowered to start analyzing and prioritizing their investment needs based on their own grounded sets of opportunities and constraints, they can start to hold their governments accountable.</p>
                           <p>Connecting further to the grassroots through targeting community-based networks that serve youth or religious groups is similarly viewed as critical to advancing citizen empowerment. Mobilizing other networks to embrace actions that promote food security can be achieved by making the CAADP framework better understood.</p>
                           <p>Government ministries will not invest in &ldquo;mainstreaming&rdquo; CAADP within their own countries because there are inherent tensions &ndash; conflicts of interest manifested in idiosyncratic ways in each of the ten country studies. Likewise even though regional and continental institutions supported by donors to provide the &ldquo;institutional architecture&rdquo; for the four CAADP pillars are important, they are not capable of pushing CAADP to the next stage because they are not sufficiently connected to national contexts and it is not in their mandates to mainstream CAADP within national contexts.</p>
                           <p>Several Champions talked about overcoming this obstacle through:</p>
                           <p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Building African capacity to implement transformative leadership training, and</p>
                           <p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bringing it to scale in each country using trainer-of-trainer models in organizations with extensive networks that reach down to local levels throughout the country.</p>
                           <p>Future training should target officials in key government agencies at national and district levels to shift mindsets about the rights of farmers and the responsibilities of service providers. Tolerance of corruption needs to be reduced and insistence on transparency and accountability, increased.</p>
                           <p>&nbsp;</p>
                           <p>&nbsp;</p>
                           <p>&nbsp;</p>
                           <h1>Part Five<br />
                              Summary of Lessons Learned
                           </h1>
                           <p>The evidence from the Lessons Learned research is that the 5-day leadership and management training course piloted by Africa Lead does shift the knowledge, attitudes, motivation and behaviors of training participants into greater alignment with CAADP principles of inclusiveness, transparency and accountability.</p>
                           <p>Africa Lead&rsquo;s methodology empowers Champions with the commitment and skills they need to begin establishing new standards of leadership in their individual work and, in some cases, in their organizations. In optimal cases it also improves communication and collaboration between institutions and sectors by building essential bridges among government agencies, universities and research institutes, and a range of non-state actors and networks. Taken together, these effects hold potential for improving processes that are key to the future development of African agriculture, including:</p>
                           <p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The evolution of policy reforms.</p>
                           <p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Greater inclusiveness and transparency of investments in agriculture.</p>
                           <p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Greater accountability to ensure investments have impacts on food security.</p>
                           <p>These reflections on achieving CAADP policy goals pose an array of solutions from the household level (nutrition value) to producer (cooperating for volume) and trader (export market expansion) and policymaker (balancing domestic proirities with regional exigencies).</p>
                           <p>Institutionalized Attributes from the Training Methodology. The methodology of the training combined with the selectively diverse cross-section of participants has reinforced attributes of <strong>collaborative</strong> and <strong>comparative</strong> learning. The participatory exercise and group work have fostered a continuing appreciation for the necessity of collaboration to tackle a problem as complex as food security. As illustrated above these techniques have transcendent value able to be applied in a variety of training contexts.</p>
                           <p>Improving Communication/Coordination Between Institutions and Sectors. Champions express the conviction that employing these techniques will build essential bridges with government agencies, universities and community-based groups. Repeatedly those interviewed recognize the importance of learning across borders &ndash; literally national boundaries, such as comparing land policy from one country to the next &ndash; but also the boundaries that separate different institutions. Several see added value to their own organizations from better cross-organizational coordination. Whether in terms of effectiveness through more &ldquo;harmonized synergy&rdquo; or more fundamentally in reducing duplication of effort, improving communication and information-sharing are viewed as important attributes to carry forward.</p>
                           <p>Management Insights. Whether in the context of working across different institutions, or even within their own organizations, Champions reflect on the opportunity to <strong>coordinate</strong> better and <strong>manage</strong> their own performance more effectively. Some even suggest that money is not the problem, nor a lack of knowledge, but rather that it is the management that is missing.</p>
                           <p>Independent Thinking and Practical Action. Champions stress the need for practical, achievable ways forward. They see value in exploiting the power of the training that creates<strong> independent thinkers and actors</strong> who can take practical action in the interest of food security and potentially overcome &ldquo;policy for policy&rsquo;s sake&rdquo;. One route to rectify this disconnect between policy intent and policy implementation is to proactively inform and educate. Champions suggest more emphasis on economic literacy and policy analysis broken down and conveyed in accessible terminology and context. This will enable more actors throughout the agricultural sector to work constructively to common ends.</p>
                           <p>Demystifying CAADP. Champions appreciate the greater understanding gained about CAADP through the Africa Lead experience. Going forward, they see the need to &ldquo;demystify CAADP&rdquo; for others in agricultural value chain. Considering how many report that the Africa Lead training enlightened them on CAADP, they see this as something that deserves to be more widely shared. In part, the Champions take this as their mission. The news media are viewed as another important channel for reaching key constituencies, such as farmers and farmer-based organizations.</p>
                           <p>When reflecting on the real promise of CAADP objectives to bring food security to the continent, Champions view challenges as problems that are solvable. They credit the Africa Lead experience with both enlightenment on these challenges and the tools to devise workable remedies.</p>
                           <p>Transformative leadership and management training holds this potential because it addresses an important gap identified by Champions from every country. This is the gap between high level agriculture sector planning and the<em> empowerment</em> of ordinary people to mobilize to advance food security at sub-national, national or regional levels. As was initially hoped of the Africa Lead program in 2010, the methodology is highly effective at stimulating the development of leaders who are motivated and capable of engaging with their national governments to drive transformations in their countries&rsquo; food sectors.</p>
                           <p>Scaling comes from continuing to apply the transformative thrust and diversity principles to consolidate norms of engagement across sectors. This will transcend adversarial and/or hierarchical relational structures that now hold back agriculture systems and generate common frames of reference whereby stakeholders from different sectors begin to perceive themselves as working together toward the same goals.</p>
                           <p>At the same time, processes are needed to ensure quality control and continuous upgrading of the capacity of trainers. Provision of this support and quality control could be an important point of intersection between regional CAADP organizations and organizations mainstreaming CAADP at the national level.</p>

                           <h1>Energizing and Re-energizing Champions for Change for Food Security:&nbsp; Lessons Learned from Africa Lead Leadership Training</h1>
                           <strong>Introduction</strong>
                           <p>Africa Lead, the Africa Leadership Training and Capacity Building Program, was initially a two-year task order under the RAISE Plus Indefinite Quantity Contract (IQC) mechanism, designed to run from September 20, 2010 to September 30, 2012, with a budget ceiling of $21,332,381. As of a September 30, 2012 contract modification, the program was extended for one year (through September 2013) and the ceiling was raised by $4,850,000 to $26,182,381. Africa Lead is being implemented by lead RAISE Plus IQC holder, DAI, supported by Management Systems International (MSI), Winrock International, Training Resources Group (TRG), ECI Africa Consulting (Pty) Ltd., and Michigan State University (MSU).</p>
                           <p>From the beginning of the program until July 31, 2012 Africa Lead was implemented through three regional offices&ndash;Accra, Ghana; Nairobi, Kenya; and Pretoria, South Africa &ndash; each run by a Regional Deputy Chief of Party (DCOP). Since closure of the Pretoria office, program implementation for Southern Africa has been handled primarily by the Nairobi office, now designated as the Africa Lead East and Southern Africa (ESA) office. Program implementation and operations in the Nairobi and Accra offices are supported by a Bethesda-based office headed by the program COP.</p>
                           <p>The purpose of the program is to support the capacity building program of the US Government&rsquo;s Feed the Future (FTF) Initiative, which aligns U.S. Government development assistance with Africa-owned agriculture development plans that are, in turn, aligned with the African Union&rsquo;s Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Program (CAADP). CAADP seeks to contribute to the MDG goals by ensuring that governments throughout the continent apply 10% of their public budgets to agriculture in an effort to achieve the 6% annual growth in agricultural productivity that is needed to achieve sustainable food security throughout the continent.</p>
                           <p>Africa Lead provides leadership training, capacity assessments, logistical support for training and innovative short courses and internships/twinning arrangements prioritized in consultation with missions and partner countries and institutions, and a database of training offerings on the continent that can be matched to the leadership training and capacity building needs.</p>
                           <h1>Purpose of Report</h1>
                           <p>&nbsp;</p>
                           <p>The purpose of this report is to describe the Champions for Change leadership training that Africa Lead provided, and to capture the main lessons that have been learned from the design, customization and delivery of the course. The report also seeks to drive improvements from these lessons that will make future leadership training more effective in developing a cadre, network and critical mass of champions and in strengthening the institutions within which they work.&nbsp; A final purpose of the report is to identify how leadership training might be injected into other types of training in such a way as to achieve scale in leadership training and to ground the leadership training by identifying the &ldquo;leadership training for what?&rdquo; question.</p>
                           <h1>Goal of Champions for Change Training</h1>
                           <p>&nbsp;</p>
                           <p>The goal of the Champions for Change training, as stated in the Africa Lead contract, is to &ldquo;Build a cadre of African leaders to design and implement food security strategies and investment plans.&rdquo;&nbsp; Translated into the language of a vision for the program, Africa Lead seeks to contribute to the overall goal of helping Africa achieve, &ldquo;Better designed, delivered, implemented and measured agriculture policies, programs and enterprises in Africa, leading to greater agricultural productivity and food security.&rdquo;</p>
                           <p>&nbsp;Africa Lead does no prior assessments of the need for leadership training.&nbsp; The impetus to provide leadership training comes from CAADP imperatives for transformational change and for &ldquo;business unusual,&rsquo; namely that to move African agriculture to the new plane of productivity needed for achieving the MDGs, innovative, transformative leadership is going to be required of leaders working in the agriculture and agribusiness sector.</p>
                           <p>Technical training overlaid on overly bureaucratic institutions is not going to &ldquo;do the trick.&rdquo; Heads of divisions, departments, agencies and ministries need to know how to effectively manage transformational change. They need to know how to create a sense of urgency, build a sustaining team within their own organizations and across agencies and otherwise motivate staff, colleagues and superiors to combine forces toward achievable and measurable results.&nbsp; The Africa Lead Module One (Leadership and Change Management) and Module Two (Program Design and Implementation Tools) trainings are designed to build that force multiplier that drives effective leaders.</p>
                           <h1>Methodology and Structure of Training</h1>
                           <p>&nbsp;</p>
                           <p>Immediately upon award of the Task Order contract, Africa Lead deployed senior trainers and training design specialists to the task of developing a five day course including presentational material, trainer guides and participant manuals.&nbsp; The curriculum is designed to be highly interactive and to be maximally effective within an adult learning context.&nbsp; It was ground-truthed during a training-of-trainers (TOT) session in Nairobi during which highly experienced regional African trainers reviewed the material, learned what the objectives of the training were.&nbsp; The regional African trainers contextualized the material and the approach in a way that ensures that the material will both &ldquo;get to the heart and to the head&rdquo; of African training participants.</p>
                           <p><img src="img/whatsherstory3.png" id="whatsherstory3" style="height:300px" /></p>
                           <p>The combination of inputs from international experts in adult learning techniques and regional experts has resulted in a powerful curriculum, methodology and approach to the Champions training.&nbsp; Two devices are of particular note in this regard.&nbsp; First the use of imagery and symbolism/ceremony helps to get at the heart.&nbsp; The imagery of a small girl whose future is clearly in doubt as a result of her gender, poverty, food insecurity and climate change challenges is especially powerful.&nbsp; Participants are asked to give the girl a name and to imagine her future based on specified criteria that will challenge her chance to grow up healthy and productive.&nbsp; This produces a visceral connection to the girl as representing the urgency of the food security challenge in Africa.</p>
                           <p>The ceremony aspect revolves around the African &ldquo;food security&rdquo; or food storage pot.&nbsp; The idea is that the pot has been broken and/or left unfilled and that this is the symbolism of the food security challenge before African Food Security Champions.&nbsp; As particularly insightful interventions and comments are made during the training, the trainers and then later other participants exhort the innovator to &ldquo;fill the pot&rdquo; or to &ldquo;mend the pot, fill the pot,&rdquo; with grain kept to the side of the pot.&nbsp; The imagery of the little girl and the symbolism of filling the African food security pot are together the foundation of the Champions brand.&nbsp; African food security Champions for Change are marked by their sense of agency and urgency.&nbsp; These symbols and images helped ensure that the training went beyond the &ldquo;head&rdquo; and to the &ldquo;heart.&rdquo;</p>
                           <p>The course is a 40-hour residential training course with extensive use of exercises designed to get the participants out of their comfort zones and to force them to look at common problems from different perspectives.&nbsp; The course is divided into seven &ldquo;themes&rdquo; over the course of five days of training (look for the Trainers Guide coming to the Africa Lead website in 2014):</p>

                           <p>Participants are encouraged to engage in journaling and individual planning at the end of each day as a way to reinforce the learning process and ensure that the action plans produced at the end of the training will be realistic and discrete enough to be actionable and under the control of the Champion upon his or her completion of the training.</p>
                           <p>Training workshops are conducted for cohorts of between 25 and 35 participants.&nbsp; This size is considered optimal for a training in which extensive discussions, exchanges and facilitated exercises are core to the learning experience.</p>
                           <p>There are &nbsp;multiple objectives of the training. The main objectives being the development of a stronger understanding of CAADP, food security and each participant&rsquo;s role in securing a food secure future for his or her country and region.&nbsp; Also, the understanding and application of change management and leadership tools and skills is a critical objective of the training.</p>
                           <p>Ultimately, the development hypothesis underlying the Champions for Change training is that a critical mass of innovative, results-focused agriculture leaders from across the spectrum of agriculture and food security stakeholders will result in better policies and programs; that &ldquo;governance&rdquo; in agriculture will make the critical difference for food security.</p>
                           <h1>Objectives:</h1>
                           <p><strong>By the end of the training, participants will be able to:</strong></p>

                           <strong>Number and Type of Champions Trained</strong>
                           <p>A large number of agriculture leaders have been trained by Africa Lead.&nbsp; Here we focus on those who have been through the above-mentioned Champions for Change training (Task One Module One).&nbsp; It is important to mention, however, that while there are many workshops in which the standard five day, 40 hour Champions for Change training has been provided, there are also multiple variants of the standard training.&nbsp; Meaning no disrespect to participants in other trainings, Africa Lead has generally reserved the title &ldquo;Champions for Change for Food Security&rdquo; for agriculture leaders who have been through the full training. There is no doubt that there are other &ldquo;champions&rdquo; for transformation in agriculture and food security besides the Africa Lead-trained Champions.&nbsp; Here we refer to graduates of the standard Champions for Change training.</p>
                           <p>The program has trained <span class="highlightimage" data="module1_participants_by_region">1,343 agriculture leaders</span> in the five day Champions for Change training, which has been provided in 54 separate training workshops to classes of approximately 24 participants representing 29 countries overall , including 575 Champions for Change in East Africa, 375 in West Africa, and 393 in Southern Africa. Africa Lead targets a 50/50 gender split of trainees, ending up with 35 percent of the participants being female.</p>

                           <p>Africa Lead understands that to be credible, any true assessment of program impact must be done by a disinterested, independent consultant or organization. Nonetheless, for the program&rsquo;s own management, monitoring, reporting and learning purposes, Africa Lead undertakes to determine how the Champions training is perceived by participants both in the short term (views about how the training is conducted) and the medium and long term (views on behavior change impact of the training).</p>
                           <p>With respect to how participants viewed the training, <span class="highlightimage" data="table_participants_by_region">the table below</span> clearly presents the point that has been made anecdotally in one-on-one conversations, workshops and meetings, namely that the training has been exceptionally well received.</p>

                           <p>There is a very high level of appreciation of the quality of the African regional trainers and their ability to motivate the participants during the training sessions.&nbsp; This relates to the trainers&rsquo; ability to put the Kotter material and other material into the proper context for African agricultural experts and agribusiness people.<span class="infotip" data="John Kotter’s 8-Step Change Model was a core element of the training provided in the Champions for Change leadership training discussed here.">&loz;</span>&nbsp; Participants appreciate the emphasis on practical learning that emphasized adult learning techniques rather than dry lecture style presentation.&nbsp;</p>
                           <p>In extensive interviews with a sample of Champions a year or more after their training there reveals a continuing sense that the training has affected participants&rsquo; lives both personally and professionally.</p>

                           <h1 style="clear:both">The Champions Brand</h1>
                           <p>Consensus from the Lessons Learned workshop held at the Windsor Hotel in Nairobi on 11-12 June 2013 is that the Africa Lead CAADP and leadership training has created a powerful Champions brand of transformed African agriculture leaders.&nbsp; Characteristics of the Champions brand include:</p>
                           <p>&nbsp;</p>
                           <ol>
                              <li>a greater sense of urgency about food security</li>
                              <li>understanding of CAADP and its role at all levels</li>
                              <li>a sense of being part of a bigger effort</li>
                              <li>mutual support and recognition and a desire to establish a supporting network</li>
                              <li>a desire to do things differently, to innovate in leading and collaborating with others towards a common goal; and</li>
                              <li>a desire to develop other leaders or Champions</li>
                           </ol>
                           <p>This outcome of the Champions for Change transformational leadership training exceeds the goal of building a &ldquo;&hellip;cadre of African leaders to design and implement food security strategies and investment plans.&rdquo;&nbsp; The outcome far exceeds expectations since as in the words of one of the Nairobi participants, the training created a kind of &ldquo;religion&rdquo; about leadership for food security.</p>
                           <h1>Conclusions and Lessons Learned</h1>
                           <p>&nbsp;</p>
                           <p>Responses from participants and observers alike indicate that the Champions for Change training is a transformative experience that in many cases is pivotal to behavior change among the individual participants in the training.&nbsp; This is largely anecdotal evidence, of course, of the impact of the training and needs to be corroborated by more independent, objective and scientific evidence. The best that Africa Lead has been able to do is to incorporate extensive, focused interviews with a purposive subsample of Champions from most of the countries that received the leadership training.&nbsp; From those lessons learned interviews and from a mid-term and end-of-project workshop, Africa Lead has pieced together some key lessons that should guide subsequent leadership training and broader capacity building for agriculture productivity and food security.</p>
                           <h1>The lessons are the following (grouped into the three categories below):</h1>
                           <p><strong>What makes the Champions for Change 40 hours of training so powerful?</strong></p>
                           <ul>
                              <li>The combination of highly experienced and qualified African and International training experts has proven to be a determinant of the effectiveness of the training.&nbsp; By using the best international development training and curriculum minds to develop a curriculum that is then customized or Africanized by the best regional African development trainers and facilitators, Africa Lead is able to provide a training that captures international best practices AND is able to reach the &ldquo;heads and hearts&rdquo; of an African audience.&nbsp; The customization does not end with the first training but is a continuous process with trainers and training managers constantly tweaking the curriculum and the way concepts are explained and discussed. This results from a systematic daily review and critique among the training team of the presentations and reactions from participants, which are then fed into further adaptation of the material and presentation.</li>
                              <li>Leadership training is not provided in isolation of the reason for the training. Combining leadership training with a very clear and urgent purpose for the leadership training is an effective combination, giving meaning to the leadership training. In the case of the Champions for Change leadership training the &ldquo;for what?&rdquo; question is answered in the latter part of the training title, &ldquo;&hellip;For Food Security.&rdquo;&nbsp; The more formal title of the training also captures the &ldquo;for what?&rdquo; question, &ldquo;Scaling up for Food Security in Africa:&nbsp; Champions for Change Leadership Training.&rdquo; The Lessons Learned research interviews with more than 100 champions across countries that each have at least 100 champions trained unearths this element of the training and explains how it has been instrumental to the behavior change experienced by many participants.</li>
                              <li>The symbolism of the Broken African Pot and how it is used as a motivational tool is cited frequently by Champions as a memorable innovation and symbol for sustained commitment.</li>
                           </ul>

                              <li>The imagery of the little girl and the exercise designed to &ldquo;tell her story,&rdquo; is exceptionally powerful and has brought training participants to the point of tears. The effect of personalizing poverty and imagining futures for the girl deepens the sense of urgency for improving food security and a sense of personal responsibility. Already in Africa, agricultural professionals are increasingly removed from the rural poverty they are expected to help resolve.</li>

                           <ul>
                              <li>There is consensus within the project that combining technical training with imagery (little girl) and symbolism (African food security pot) designed to get at the heart and create a sense of shared urgency is the most effective combination for the training.&nbsp; It seems to have the longest, most sustained impact on participants in the training.</li>
                              <li>Residential training in which the participants stay together in one place for the duration of the week-long training helps foster an &ldquo;esprit de corps&rdquo; and an exchange of ideas outside of classroom exercises and learning facilitation.</li>
                              <li>The use of adult learning techniques that emphasizes discussion and employs exercises designed to draw out experiences of relevance to the topics being discussed. These reinforce a sense of purpose and forge a commitment to participatory process.</li>
                           </ul>

                           <ul>
                              <li>While one of the very first documents produced on the project was entitled, <em>&ldquo;Criteria for Selection of Trainees for Module 1 Training&rdquo;</em> (September 20, 2010; attached as Appendix One to this report), selection of participants for training has not always been as systematic as it needs to be resulting in some cases in participants who do not fully meet the criteria identified in the training selection document. Selection was supposed to have been done in conjunction with the missions funding the training and with their government and development partner counterparts. The reality is that selection more often has been done uniquely by the field staff with little involvement from missions. It may have been more effective to have provided leadership training to a critical mass of influencers or potential influencers and team leaders from targeted organizations, public, and non-state organizations alike.</li>
                              <li>Champions feel that there is little in the way of organized post-training support for them to coach them in their application of the skills they have learned. This is not so much a reflection on the training per se, but in the lack of a more holistic capacity building support to Champions. This lack of post-training support is most evident in relation to the action plans that each training participant develops, and the need to work more effectively to apply the elements of those action plans.</li>
                              <li>The process of action planning may have been a casualty of the many other topics that need to be covered during the training, including the concept of food security and the principles, processes and objectives of CAADP.&nbsp; Subsequent leadership trainings should attempt to weave in action planning more integrally from the very start so the action plans are more actionable at the end and can be shared with Africa Lead and other Champions to enhance mutual accountability. This integration can also guide coaching and facilitation that could be provided to Champions by the project.</li>
                              <li>Some participants state that the training is too packed and there is insufficient time to dig more deeply into the various topics and skills presented during the five days.&nbsp; This suggests a demand for more in-depth training in some of the material covered in the 12 sessions.</li>
                           </ul>
                           <h1>Looking Forward</h1>
                           <p>The idea that the Champions would form a cadre of African leaders to spearhead a new transformation of agriculture and food security on the continent appears to have been prescient. There have been too many testimonials from Champions and observers of the Champions alike for this to be seen as a fluke.</p>
                           <p>The Champion brand is recognized across the continent as describing energetic, visionary agriculturalists who understand that waiting for someone else to make the move is not an option.&nbsp; Representatives of the Champion brand understand that the challenge of agricultural productivity and food security is everyone&rsquo;s regardless of what level of official power he or she has. They see that the challenge is urgent and can be addressed best through developing teams with common goals and clear objectives. The new ideas, new ways of looking at things and innovation needed for the transformation will come from ensuring that old, hierarchical ways of making decisions give way to more modern consultative ways in which all ideas are given a chance regardless of position or standing.</p>
                           <p>Individually, most Champions are not in a position to radically transform the ways their organizations, communities or countries work.&nbsp; They need the support of a critical mass to be able to affect their own organizations and the broader ethos in their communities, countries and regions as well as across the continent.&nbsp; Thus a focus on scaling up the leadership training, strengthening networks and exchanges among Champions, and helping trained agricultural leaders to transform the institutions in which they work are the critical next steps towards developing capable and results-focused organizations. These can in turn design better, deliver more effectively and efficiently, and use measurement and evidence to improve design and delivery of both policies and programs that will allow the private sector and households to improve agricultural productivity and food security.</p>
                           <p>Africa Lead suggests that the lessons learned from program implementation show that leadership training coupled with institutional capacity building and scaling up of leadership training are likely to bear fruit in terms of better performing institutions that are more results-focused. It will also result in better policies grounded in the economic realities that with a conducive policy environment it is the African private sector (small farmers and small agri-processors included) that will unleash the powerful innovative potential of millions of African agriculturalists and entrepreneurs who will drive agricultural transformation.</p>

                           <p>Criteria for Selection of Trainees for Module 1 Training</p>
                           <p><strong>Background</strong></p>
                           <p>The ALTCAP project seeks to strengthen the ability of leaders and key decision-makers in the region to develop and implement prioritized, realistic and measurable programs that will build Africa&rsquo;s capacity to feed itself and provide a solid foundation for subsequent agriculture led growth and&nbsp; economic development.&nbsp; Given the size of the challenge relative to the funds available it is critical that the program identifies and selects&nbsp; participants that have the&nbsp; greatest probability and potential to drive change within their respective organizations which in turn will lead to the achievement of Feed the Future country investment plan objectives. Ensuring that the right people get the training intended for leaders involved in agriculture prioritization, strategic planning and development is an important first step in strengthening agriculture strategy , planning and implementation&nbsp; functions in the FTF target countries.&nbsp; We seek individuals who are strongly dedicated to driving broad based change and to developing&nbsp; their respective country&rsquo;s agriculture sector as a way of strenghtening&nbsp; the foundations for&nbsp; broader economic development throughout the continent.</p>
                           <p>We understand that we are to work with USAID regional and bilateral missions to identify and invite African leaders to participate in the leadership training workshops, and that they, in turn, need to collaborate with government and other stakeholders to ensure that the leaders invited are widely understood to have stature in the agriculture development community and as such will be able to have a measurable impact on the nature of agriculture investment programs.&nbsp;</p>
                           <p>In addition to initial selection/recommendation by USAID, prospective participants must complete an application form and fit most of the criteria of selection outlined below.&nbsp; Moreover, they must be nominated and supported by their organization, i.e. their supervisor/manager must agree in writing by completing a nomination form that after the training the individual will receive their full&nbsp; support and backing to implement change strategies within the organization to achieve FTF outcomes.</p>
                           <p>&nbsp;</p>

                           <h1>Champions for Change: Sustaining the Momentum Through Results-Oriented Action Plans.</h1>
                           <h1>Introduction</h1>
                           <p>The Module Two training program is an initiative under Africa Lead Task One: Provision of Leadership Training to African Food Security Leaders. A major focus of Task One is to address the leadership and management gap in agriculture institutions engaged in the process of identifying, prioritizing and implementing strong agriculture policies, investments and programs. An equally important component of Task One is to raise awareness of CAADP&lsquo;s principles, processes and goals.</p>
                           <p>By January 2012, when the standard Module Two program was launched, Africa Lead had been operating for more than one year in support of CAADP and its Regional Agricultural Investment Programs (RAIPs) and National Agricultural Investment Programs (NAIPs). Module One training was being delivered at a rapid pace and &ldquo;Champions&rdquo; were acquiring knowledge, skills and attitudes related to understanding CAADP goals, new perspectives on food security, strategies for leading and managing change, strategic thinking and planning skills, advocacy skills, leadership skills, and monitoring and evaluation concepts and practices.</p>
                           <p>The evaluation findings for the Module One training were very positive. After the first year of activity, Africa Lead regional offices reported that Champions at regional and country levels were leaving the Module One training program highly motivated and that they were establishing and broadening networks for action in their countries and regions. The three Africa Lead regions had trained over 1,000 &ldquo;Champions&rdquo; from 29 countries in Module One in both English and French, including 575 Champions for Change in East Africa, 375 in West Africa, and 393 in Southern Africa. Module One training was achieving its purpose &ldquo;To inspire, energize and mobilize innovative leaders, champions, and thinkers in African countries, who are committed to creative new approaches to achieving food security.&rdquo;</p>
                           <p>The Africa Lead Module Two program is designed to build on the momentum of Module One and to provide &ldquo;Champions&rdquo; with a critical set of complementary project implementation skills and practical methods required to move the CAADP implementation process forward. The focus of Module Two is to ensure that national, regional, organizational and unit action plans in support of CAADP are followed and that these plans show tangible, positive results.</p>
                           <p>In this report we describe the process for designing and implementing the Africa Lead Module Two program, identify program achievements and challenges, report on lessons learned and share recommendations for future Feed the Future and CAADP interventions.</p>
                           <p>&nbsp;</p>
                           <h1>Module Two Concept and Structure</h1>
                           <h2>strategic geographic focus</h2>
                           <p>Africa Lead has conceptualized the Module Two program to be implemented on a country or region-specific basis, with content specifically tailored to meet the identified needs in these geographic areas.</p>
                           <h2>Target Audience</h2>
                           <p>Module Two targets two sets of participants: (1) previous beneficiaries from Module One who have demonstrated strong leadership aptitude, alignment with the CAADP and FTF approaches, and who have been identified by USAID missions and CAADP country/regional teams as food security Champions likely to benefit from deepening their knowledge and further developing skill sets for leading change; and (2) CAADP focal points, country teams and key individuals involved in implementing NAIPs and/or RAIPs and overseeing the implementation process.</p>
                           <h2>Assumptions</h2>
                           <p>The designers of the Module Two intervention operated under the following assumptions:</p>
                           <p>&sect;&nbsp; The primary target audience for participating countries and regions is the country or regional implementation teams, which includes representatives of the CAADP Country Teams (CCTs), regional agricultural and rural development teams, selected Champions from the Module One training program, representatives from the ministries of agriculture and other key stakeholders.</p>
                           <p>&sect;&nbsp; The most effective and efficient structure is to focus on work in individual countries and with regional bodies.</p>
                           <p>&sect;&nbsp; There is a critical need to support follow up of the country teams from both Modules One and Two in order to maintain momentum, to continue monitoring progress and to ensure that the concepts that have been learned and the enthusiasm that has been established result in real and productive change. For regional teams, the Module Two intervention provides an opportunity to integrate new skills into the work of developing and implementing plans.</p>
                           <h2>structure</h2>
                           <p>Module Two takes the form of country and region-specific interventions with key people and institutions as they continue to refine and implement their action plans.</p>
                           <p>Module Two facilitation teams work with regional and country teams responsible for NAIP/RAIP implementation individually so as to insure a focus on specific needs and action plans and the broadest inclusion of stakeholders in each country and region. Facilitators work with country and regional teams in separate workshops. The two focus West Africa countries that have engaged in the Module Two intervention are Ghana and Liberia.&nbsp; Africa Lead East Africa Region conducted three regional Module Two workshops; one in Nairobi, Kenya, one in Entebbe, Uganda and one in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.</p>
                           <img src="img/module2_weeklymeetings.png" class="image_right" id="module2_weeklymeetings"  style="height:300px" />
                           <p>Each participating country or region is requested to identify several agricultural productivity / food security projects and to send project teams to participate in a Module Two intervention. Project representatives are instructed in the Rapid Results Approach (RRA) and each team develops a plan for a Rapid Results Initiative (RRI) during the workshop. The advantages of RRA are that projects produce results very quickly, new work patterns are identified and lessons are learned about specific interventions and the process of managing change. The lessons learned from RRA projects are used to support broader and longer-term goals for NAIP/RAIP implementation.</p>
                           <p>&nbsp;</p>
                           <h1>Module Two Curriculum Design Process</h1>
                           <p>The standard four-day Module Two curriculum has been designed by Africa Lead headquarters staff with guidance, direction and input from USAID Washington, USAID regional and bi-lateral missions, Africa Lead regional office staff and trainers and food security development partners operating in Sub-Saharan Africa. The Task One design team developed and circulated several Module Two concept papers for review and comment during the summer of 2011. The design team modified the concept, based on guidance received during the review process. The design team also administered a survey to Africa Lead regional trainers to obtain their perspectives based on their experiences with the Module One training program and their knowledge of prospective Module Two target populations. The Task One team conducted a pilot delivery of the Module Two curriculum for 11 WA Regional Africa Lead trainers in Ghana in September 2011 and finalized the curriculum during the following months.</p>
                           <p>Africa Lead determined early on that a project implementation methodology would be a key component of the Module Two curriculum. On behalf of Africa Lead, Development Alternatives International (DAI) issued a call for proposals in May 2010 for curriculum design assistance for such a project implementation methodology. The Rapid Results Institute was the successful bidder and was awarded a purchase order by DAI in September 2010 to complete this task.</p>
                           <p>&nbsp;</p>
                           <p>The Institute tailored their Rapid Results Approach (RRA) to fit within the Module Two curriculum and to address the CAADP implementation process. RRA is a methodology which utilizes action planning tools and coaching to help project teams obtain concrete results in support of longer-term work plans within a period of approximately 100 days. The RRA concept is designed to help project teams successfully complete ambitious 100 day projects, thereby providing further innovation, motivation and lessons learned to support continued success and progress in longer-term program implementation. RRA has become the centerpiece of the Module Two training program.</p>
                           <p>&nbsp;</p>
                           <p>Prior to the launch of the standard Module Two training program, the Task One headquarters team supported the EA Regional Africa Lead office and USAID/Tanzania with the design of a specialized Module Two curriculum in support of the USAID FORWARD localization initiative. This event was held October 24-28, 2011. The program was a five day intensive course on best practices in financial management, transparent procurement, project design, and monitoring and evaluation to support Feed the Future&rsquo;s goal of aligning resources with country-owned processes and procurement reform.</p>
                           <p>In the spring and summer of 2012, the EA Africa Lead office and the Task One headquarters team designed a five day modified regional Module Two workshop. This workshop incorporated the standard Module Two sessions and included additional sessions on regional topics such as policy analysis, cross-border trade, development of regional compacts and investment frameworks, diseases and pests, public health and nutrition, and sanitary and phytosanitary standards (SPS). &nbsp;</p>
                           <h1>Module Two Program Delivery Preparation</h1>
                           <img src="img/module2_stick.png" class="image_right" id="module2_stick"  style="height:250px" />
                           <p>In preparation for the launch of the standard Module Two training program in West Africa, the Task One headquarters team delivered a training of trainers (TOT) event for Module Two Africa Lead WA Regional trainers in January 2012. Prior to the WA Module Two training deliveries in Ghana and Liberia, the WA Regional Africa Lead office and the Task One Headquarters team conducted a meeting in each country for senior leaders of participating organizations. A similar Module Two Training of Trainers event was conducted in Nairobi, Kenya August 1-4, 2012 with three EA trainers/facilitators and two EA subject matter experts. 
                           </p>
                           <p>The purpose of the preparatory country meetings is to ensure that senior leaders attain a thorough understanding of Rapid Results Initiatives (RRIs) and how they are different from &ldquo;100 day projects&rdquo;, discuss how the &nbsp;Rapid Results Approach (RRA) can be used to build capacity for NAIP/RAIP implementation and identify challenge areas and team members for Rapid Results teams. The senior leader meetings also provide an opportunity for organizational leaders to buy-in to Module Two and the RRA and to establish their accountability to support RRIs implemented by their organizations&rsquo; teams</p>

                           <h1>Module Two Program Implementation</h1>
                           <p>Africa Lead delivered a specialized Module Two event in October 2011 at the request of USAID/Tanzania and in support of the USAID FORWARD localization initiative. This specialized version of Module Two was designed to build the capacity of Tanzanian institutions to directly receive and manage US government funds for USAID-funded agriculture development projects. This curriculum, which was offered to 40 individuals representing USAID/Tanzania implementing partners, included information on financial management, procurement, and USAID and FTF policies and procedures.</p>
                           <p>WA Regional Trainers, with Task One headquarters support, launched what was to become the standard four-day Module Two workshop March 27-30, 2012 at the Shai Hills preserve Ghana. WA Regional trainers conducted two subsequent Module Two training events in Ghana, between April and June 2012, for a total of four events. Approximately 100 participants from several organizations were trained in Module Two in Ghana.&nbsp;</p>
                           <p>WA Regional Trainers, with support from the Task One headquarters team, launched the standard four-day Module Two workshop April 2012 in Monrovia, Liberia. WA Regional trainers conducted three subsequent Module Two training events in Liberia between May and July 2012, for a total of four events. Approximately 100 participants were trained in Module Two in Liberia.</p>
                           <p>EA Regional Trainers, with support from the Task One headquarters team, delivered a five-day regional Module Two workshop in Nairobi, Kenya, August 6-10, 2012, with support from the Task One headquarters team. WA Regional trainers conducted two subsequent regional Module Two training events; one in Entebbe, Uganda and one in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.</p>

                           <p><strong>The Rapid Results Approach (RRA)</strong> &ndash; is a management and project implementation technique which involves teams in organizations or consortiums committing to highly ambitious 100-day goals, and then persisting until these goals are achieved. The technique was developed by Schaffer Consulting, which used the concept for decades in the private sector. The technique has been adapted for non-profit work by the Rapid Results Institute, a Schaffer Consulting affiliate, and it has it has been used in development projects across Sub-Saharan Africa, South America, the United States, and the Middle East since 2007.</p>
                           <p>The Rapid Results Institute collaborated with Africa Lead to include RRA as a key component of the Module Two curriculum. Three hundred thirty-three individuals from 23 African countries were trained in Module Two and RRA and several organizational and regional teams successfully completed 100-day projects.</p>

                              Objectives:
                              After participating in the Module Two intervention, implementation teams of champions will be able to:
                              § Identify and develop strategic coordination mechanisms for CAADP and NAIPs/RAIPs
                              § Identify and agree to the most critical steps for CAADP NAIP/RAIP implementation 
                              § Appreciate the necessary steps and activities in successful project and program design
                              § Integrate the project design elements into on-going NAIPs/RAIPs
                              § Apply appropriate project management, monitoring and evaluation methodologies to plans/projects 
                              § Use the Rapid Results Approach (RRA) to develop 100-day action plans.

                              <li><strong>Lack of Resources for Post Module Two Workshop Follow Up. </strong>Africa Lead lacks resources to provide follow up support to workshop participants after completion of Module Two training. The Module Two training is deemed by participants to have been a valuable capacity building intervention in training evaluations completed immediately following the workshops. Without resources to follow up with participants after the training, Africa Lead is unable to assess the progress of participants or their sponsoring organization after the training workshops ended. Neither is Africa Lead able to provide follow up support that is typically necessary to help training participants complete their post-training action plans and goals.</li>

                              <li><strong>A principle feature of RRA is the provision of follow up coaching support for RRA teams. </strong>The purpose of follow up by RRA coaches is to provide support and guidance to RRA teams as they work to implement their &ldquo;100-day&rdquo; plans. Since Africa Lead lacks the resources to provide coaching support, RRA teams are on their own as they set out to implement their RRIs. Africa Lead has received anecdotal reports that indicate that some RRA teams have been able to successfully complete Rapid Results Initiatives.&nbsp; Africa Lead has limited ability to substantiate these reports or to track the progress of RRA teams after they complete the Module Two workshops.</li>

                              <li><strong>One reason that Africa Lead is not able to provide coaching support for RRA teams has to do with the buy-in process for USAID mission participation in Africa Lead initiatives.</strong> In the case of Module Two, the USAID mission buy-in process was completed while the Module Two training program was still being conceptualized. In West Africa, Africa Lead and the USAID Missions followed the buy-in process that was used for Module One. This process committed Africa Lead to train 100 &ldquo;Champions&rdquo; in each participating country. The buy-in process in East Africa, while regional in focus, similarly provided funds for participants to complete Module Two training but did not support post-training coaching.</li>

                              <li><strong>Module Two Implemented Towards the End of the Africa Lead Project Cycle. </strong>When the standard Module Two program was implemented, it was late in the Africa Lead project cycle. As additional countries and mission began to gain interest in the Module Two concept, there were limited resources events. Africa Lead Regional Offices did, however, deliver several blended Module One / Module Two events, training 169 individuals.</li>

                           <p>Follow up consultation with the Rapid Results Institute has identified the following lessons related to the roll out and implementation of the Rapid Results Approach (RRA) (Note: while the Institute has supported the design of the RRA content of the Module Two curriculum it has not been involved in the roll out or implementation of the program):</p>
                           <p>&nbsp;</p>
                           <ul>
                              <li>It would have been more advantageous for Africa Lead to have focused, initially, on smaller numbers of participants in participating countries. The idea is to start with a few individuals in each country before going wide. You do not necessarily need to train 100 people per country, but rather identify smaller numbers of people from a few strategic organizations or institutions.</li>
                              <li>It would have been more advantageous for Africa Lead to have invited larger numbers of Module Two participants from each participating organization, e.g., 12 rather than three or four. It is easier for larger teams, all of whom attend the workshop, to get energized and mobilized. The Rapid Results Institute has advised Africa Lead that it is possible for larger teams, such as 12, who leave RRA training highly motivated, to achieve an approximately 60% success rate with their Rapid Results Initiative (RRI) even without follow up.</li>
                              <li>It is best to allow teams to come to the workshop and establish their Rapid Results Initiative (RRI) goals, <strong><em>before</em></strong> they select or elect their team leader. After they have established their RRI goal, allow teams to select their team leader at the workshop.</li>

                           <h1>Recommendations</h1>
                           <h1><strong>1. &nbsp;Ensure that development of capacity building interventions is a highly collaborative process involving development partners and senior leaders of institutions that will receive assistance.</strong></h1>
                           <p>&nbsp;</p>
                           <p>Development and implementation of the Module Two program has been characterized by significant interaction and engagement with a broad spectrum of partners. Partners include USAID Washington and Regional and Bilateral Missions, African government officials, African trainers, development partners and senior leaders from participating organizations. This engagement and input from a variety of perspectives has resulted in a program that focuses on high priority needs and contributes to the buy-in of the leaders of participating organizations. These factors are critical to the success achieved through the Module Two program.</p>
                           <p>&nbsp;</p>
                           <p>For the Rapid Results Approach (RRA), senior leaders of participating organizations identify the team members who attend Module Two workshops. These leaders also identify the focus areas for their organization&rsquo;s Rapid Results Initiatives and they commit, in advance, to support their teams&rsquo; implementation efforts.</p>
                           <p>&nbsp;</p>
                           <p><strong>2. &nbsp;Provide follow on support for training and networking events.</strong></p>
                           <p>&nbsp;</p>
                           <p>Build in follow up support for Module Two workshops and other capacity building interventions. Combine training and networking events with interventions that support the application of relevant skills, which bring about change in individual and organizational attitudes and practices and which encourage and support the completion of action plans. Training workshops and networking events can be beneficial as initial capacity building interventions which provide important opportunities for skill-building and collaboration. Isolated training and networking events. However they have limited potential for contributing to long-term capacity building and sustainability. Comprehensive and coordinated interventions such as coaching, mentoring, organization development, consultation, strategic planning and internships, when combined with training and networking, have the potential to achieve long-term results.</p>
                           <p>&nbsp;</p>
                           <p>For Rapid Results teams, the recommended follow up process during the project implementation phase includes:</p>
                           <ul>
                              <li>Conduct one-hour coaching meetings or calls with four or five selected team leaders every two weeks. Selected team leaders should have attended the same workshop and/or have similar RRI goals. Such meetings provide participants with additional skill-building, opportunities to report on and obtain focused support and guidance related to ongoing food security / agriculture projects and support for planning replication of successful interventions.</li>
                              <li>Use an intern to manage routine contact and data gathering with the RRI teams. This type of follow up does not have to be conducted by an experienced professional. University students are often capable to serve as competent interns. Student interns may be recruited without cost if their involvement in an RRA project is structured as a university-supervised research program.</li>
                              <li>Have the interns conduct follow up and data gathering directly (in person), not remotely.</li>
                           </ul>
                           <p>&nbsp;</p>
                           <p><strong>3. &nbsp;Utilize a robust selection process for identifying capacity building recipients.</strong></p>
                           <p>When choosing partners (capacity building recipients), consider the organizational leadership&rsquo;s track record in adaptive capacity and strategic planning in addition to the organization&rsquo;s technical capacity. Examine the governance structure for flexibility and support of strategic leadership.&nbsp; Choose partners who are self-motivated and primed to be grown for sustainability.</p>
                           <p>&nbsp;</p>
                           <p>Once partner organizations are selected, build ownership, commitment and accountability of senior leaders through joint planning workshops, action plans and/or memoranda of understanding.</p>
                           <p>&nbsp;</p>
                           <p><strong>4. &nbsp;Incorporate social enterprise/income generation strategies in order to achieving long-term sustainability.</strong></p>
                           <p>Include sustainability planning as part of agreements to provide capacity building support. Encourage and support recipient organizations to plan for and implement a variety of social enterprise/income generating strategies which include independent generation of income as well as access to other donor support. Build in accountability structures and mechanisms as a part of capacity building plans.</p>
                           <p>&nbsp;</p>
                           <p><strong>5. &nbsp;Create cascading capacity building processes as a component of large-scale capacity building.</strong></p>
                           <p>Help create the expectation that each recipient institution will be responsible for building the capacity of others involved in CAADP implementation. The assumption of this responsibility will be especially important for recipient institutions that provide oversight and/or have subcontractor/sub-grantee partners. Build the capacity of recipient institutions to provide tailored capacity building support to institutions which are parallel to them or below them in the hierarchical strata. Strategies for developing the capacity to cascade capacity building may include training in needs assessment, adult learning principles, curriculum design, coaching and mentoring, communication, consultation and action planning.</p>
                           <p>&nbsp;</p>
                           <p><strong>6. &nbsp;Engage, energize and empower government leaders to promote CAADP success.</strong></p>
                           <p>&nbsp;</p>

                           <p>To the extent possible within the CAADP framework, provide support directly to senior leaders and managers in regional, national and local public institutions to enhance their ability to manage sophisticated agricultural productivity programs. This capacity building may include areas such as change management, leadership, policy development and analysis, stakeholder engagement, advocacy and collaboration to involve civil society and the private sector.</p>

                           <p>In some countries and regions, Africa Lead has helped to energize and mobilize many Champions from non-profit and private sector organizations and has not yet achieved sufficient saturation within the higher levels of government.&nbsp; Full and committed engagement of senior government leaders is essential to CAADP success.</p>

                              and Traditional Internships
                           </h1>
                           <h1>Introduction</h1>
                           <p>&nbsp;</p>
                           <p>Africa Lead, the Africa Leadership Training and Capacity Building Program, was initially a two year task order under the RAISE Plus Indefinite Quantity Contract (IQC) mechanism, designed to run from September 20, 2010 to September 30, 2012, with a budget ceiling of $21,332,381. As of a September 30, 2012 contract modification, the Program was extended for one year (through September 2013) and the ceiling was raised by $4,850,000 to $26,182,381.</p>
                           <p>Africa Lead is being implemented by lead RAISE Plus IQC holder, DAI, in partnership with Management Systems International (MSI), Winrock International, Training Resources Group (TRG), ECI <em>Africa</em> Consulting (Pty) Ltd., and Michigan State University (MSU). From the beginning of the program until July 31, 2012 Africa Lead was implemented through three regional offices&ndash;Accra, Ghana; Nairobi, Kenya; and Pretoria, South Africa &ndash; each run by a Regional Deputy Chief of Party (DCOP). Since closure of the Pretoria office, program implementation for Southern Africa has been handled primarily by the Nairobi office, now designated as the Africa Lead East and Southern Africa (ESA) office. Program implementation and operations in the Nairobi and Accra offices are supported by a Bethesda-based office headed by the program COP.</p>
                           <p>The purpose of the program is to support the capacity building program of the US Government&rsquo;s Feed the Future (FTF) Initiative, which aligns U.S. Government development assistance with Africa-owned agriculture development plans that are, in turn, aligned with the African Union&rsquo;s Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Program (CAADP). CAADP seeks to contribute to the MDG goals by ensuring that governments throughout the continent apply 10% of their public budgets to agriculture in an effort to achieve the 6% annual growth in agricultural productivity that is needed to achieve sustainable food security throughout the continent.</p>
                           <p>Africa Lead provides leadership training, capacity assessments, logistical support for training and innovative short courses and internships/twinning arrangements prioritized in consultation with Missions and partner countries and institutions, and a database of training offerings on the continent that can be matched to the leadership training and capacity building needs.</p>
                           <h1>Purpose of Report</h1>
                           <p>&nbsp;</p>
                           <p>The purpose of this report is to present to the reader the main elements of the Africa Lead Internship Program and to provide a consideration of the lessons the Africa Lead team learned from setting up and managing the various internship placements. The lessons should then allow future internship initiatives focused on African agriculture and food security challenges to move more quickly from concept and relationship building through to overall program design, design of individual internships, management of logistical matters and successful experiential learning experiences that are of value to intern and host alike.</p>
                           <h1>Goal of Experiential Learning Internships</h1>
                           <p>&nbsp;</p>
                           <p>Under Africa Lead, the goal of experiential learning internships varies depending on the nature of the internship.&nbsp; In all cases the goal is to provide learning experience under real world conditions that will help the intern engage more deeply in some element of agricultural enterprise.</p>
                           <p>In the case of the senior internships the idea is to provide an opportunity for the entrepreneur or manager to work with counterparts in another enterprise who might be able to provide him or her new ideas on how to address technical, commercial or business process and management challenges considered to be impeding growth or profitability. These exchanges, it is hoped, will accelerate the pace of innovation and enable the intern to surmount these challenges.</p>
                           <p>For the more traditional interns the goal is to help students get practical experience in agribusiness and to give the students ideas on the types of businesses they might want to set up themselves or be engaged in upon graduation.&nbsp; A secondary goal is to reinforce among youth the value of careers in agriculture and agribusiness, a challenge that many governments have placed before themselves.</p>
                           <p>Innovation is the driver of business growth and profitability in a free market, openly competitive economy that is not distorted by crony capitalism. Looking at what is and imagining what could be is a first step. For an entrepreneur or business innovator the next step is to determine which innovations people would be willing to pay for, and finding a way to package and profitably sell those innovations embodied in goods or services. The rare individual can think through these sequences in complete isolation.&nbsp; Some have the discipline to take an idea, research it and come up with innovations. But for most people, experiencing similar innovations in other contexts can be the event that provides the innovative spark needed to adapt a technology and turn it into something marketable. The internships are designed to help provide that match. &nbsp;</p>
                           <h1>Approach to Developing B2B Exchanges and Internships</h1>
                           <p>&nbsp;</p>
                           <p>Africa Lead in collaboration with a former executive in the US retail food business and in close collaboration with USAID private sector engagement personnel undertook to develop what at the time was called the Agribusiness Leadership Program, seeded with a fund of $200,000. The approach is based on a number of steps including identifying key technical areas or themes for internships that are consistent with Feed the Future goals in general as well as in particular regions and countries.</p>
                           <p>Another step in the approach is to identify companies that have departments or divisions, or handle commodities or products of relevance to the key technical focus areas. The next step is to determine points of entry to these companies and begin to develop the personal relationships and the value propositions that will facilitate co-development of internships with a set of companies.</p>
                           <p>With initial relationships and purpose of the internships established with individual companies, the next step is to find the right intern to benefit from the experiences that a particular company or division within a company is able to provide. The potential intern is contacted, vetted and briefed on the internship program, with a key filter being the expressed interest on the part of the potential intern to travel and to be exposed to new experiences.</p>
                           <h2>Key Technical and Thematic Areas</h2>
                           <p>&nbsp;</p>
                           <p>Development of the key technical areas and themes for internships involves reviewing the commodity priorities of the Feed the Future programs in each of the Missions Africa Lead is mandated to support. It also involves meetings among the Agribusiness Leadership Program team and others to consider their views of the challenges that are going to be increasingly faced by agribusiness in providing nutritious, low-cost food to the growing demand across the continent.&nbsp; Key technical areas and themes identified include the following initial list:</p>
                           <ol>
                              <li>Farm internship (dairy, maize, rice, horticulture, etc.)</li>
                              <li>Post-harvest handling (dairy handling, horticulture, maize, rice, etc.)</li>
                              <li>Manufacturing/processing (transformation of staple crops, milling, dairy, fortification, etc.)</li>
                              <li>Agricultural financing (loans and insurance)</li>
                              <li>Fertilizer</li>
                              <li>Seeds</li>
                              <li>Veterinary services (Avian Influenza, etc.)</li>
                              <li>Commodities trading</li>
                              <li>Irrigation</li>
                              <li>Mechanization</li>
                              <li>Standards, regulations and certification</li>
                              <li>Logistics</li>
                           </ol>
                           <h2>Identification of Potential Host Companies</h2>
                           <p>&nbsp;</p>
                           <p>Potential host companies are identified by considering those that can provide useful experiential learning in the technical areas and themes above and those in which someone in or around the team has personal connections.&nbsp; If through these connections it is known the companies have some interest either in African operations or expanding into developing areas, they are selected as potential hosts.</p>
                           <p>Personal connections or prior interaction cannot be overemphasized since getting involved in a new internship program necessarily involves time and possibly other resource commitments from staff in the host organization. The chances of gaining access to key personnel so as to explain the initiative and its possible value proposition to the organization are substantially increased if the person making the pitch is known to someone in the organization. Thus, most of the host organizations with which Africa Lead works are organizations where there is a pre-existing person-to-person relationship.</p>
                           <p>This is the case with Hershey Co., which like the Johannesburg Stock Exchange focused its experiential learning opportunities on commodities trading, pricing and futures markets.&nbsp; It is also true of the Zamindara Farm Solutions internship on mechanization and innovative arrangements for leasing of farm equipment to smallholder farmers.&nbsp; And it is true of the Mars Corporation Uncle Ben&rsquo;s Rice exchange on food product development and quality assurance.&nbsp; In all cases the Africa Lead team has worked with someone who is either a direct acquaintance of one of the team or a second degree acquaintance (a friend or colleague of a friend).</p>
                           <h2>Developing Points of Entry and Value Proposition</h2>
                           <p>&nbsp;</p>
                           <p>The team member with the personal connection in the target organization then gets in touch with a key contact in the organization and makes the initial pitch for hosting senior interns.&nbsp; Africa Lead follows this up by sending a short brochure the program has prepared explaining the initiative and its purpose and possible value to a company.</p>
                           <p>Based on the team member&rsquo;s knowledge of the commercial priorities of the company, Africa Lead prepares a more detailed explanation of the value proposition as part of a tailored internship program for the potential host company. This step generally follows an initial expression of interest on the part of the target organization.</p>
                           <p>As much as possible the initial person from Africa Lead who makes the contact with the company remains the point of contact on the Africa Lead side. This is done to ensure consistency of messaging and to emphasize continuity of the relationship, an important factor in engagement in the business world. &nbsp;Following a series of phone calls and in some cases in-person meetings between the company and Africa Lead, the rough outlines and parameters of a program are developed.</p>
                           <p>Part of this process is the development of a program for the visiting professional intern, determination of its duration, the nature of the learning experience, and allocation of costs (both out of pocket and other costs) between Africa Lead and the host company. It is during this part of the process that the logistics of getting the intern to the country and supporting him or her is discussed.</p>
                           <p>Two important challenges related to logistics have to do with housing and transportation.&nbsp; Developing a program for the intern that is neither too restricting nor too open-ended is another challenge. Developing a customized program for interns is an iterative process between the host company and the Africa Lead internship team and can be a very lengthy one.</p>
                           <h2>Finding the Right Intern</h2>
                           <p>&nbsp;</p>
                           <p>Upon determining the likely host organization and setting rough parameters around the individual internship program, Africa Lead then begins the process of finding the sending organization and the senior intern who is most likely to benefit, and generate innovations, from the internship.</p>
                           <p>This involves at a first level contacting Champions involved in agriculture commodity trading, agro-processing or other aspects of agriculture-related entrepreneurship. Africa Lead has developed a set of criteria to identify the type of agri-entrepreneur or technician sought for these senior internships. The main guidelines for selection of interns include the following criteria:</p>
                           <ol>
                              <li>
                                 Intern candidates will have the experience and capacity to share their experience and skills learned within their organization. The following characteristics and credentials may serve as guidelines:
                                 <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
                                    <li>Mid-senior level staff with management responsibility</li>
                                    <li>At least 3 years of work history with their organization and a minimum of 7 years of working experience in a field relevant to the internship</li>
                                    <li>Degree in agriculture, economics, business, or related field.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                                 </ul>
                              </li>
                           </ol>
                           <p>For each potential (and interested) intern, Africa Lead asks that he or she fill out and submit to the program team and the relevant Regional DCOP a form (see attached &ldquo;Participant Profile&rdquo; form, Appendix I) that helps match the potential intern&rsquo;s background, interest and desired learning experience with the internship program being offered by the host organization.</p>
                           <p>Key information included in the profile, in this respect, is:</p>
                           <p>a) the nature of the potential intern&rsquo;s agribusiness enterprise</p>
                           <p>b) the key challenges to growth and productivity</p>
                           <p>c) the potential intern&rsquo;s own ideas on how to address these challenges</p>
                           <p>d) description of the nature of internship desired, and</p>
                           <p>e) nature of position held by potential intern, including job title and responsibilities.</p>
                           <h1>Accomplishments in B2B Exchanges and Internships</h1>
                           <p>&nbsp;</p>
                           <p>One the match is made between a candidate for in experiential learning placement with a host company, a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) is mutually agreed between Africa Lead (as legally represented by DAI) and the company.&nbsp; (See Appendix II for a model MOU template.)</p>
                           <p>&nbsp;</p>
                           <p>In rough sequential order, the B2B senior internships supported by Africa Lead are:</p>
                           <h2>Hershey Co. and Ethiopian Commodity Exchange (ECX)</h2>
                           <p>The starting point for discussions with Hershey, Pa.-based Hershey Company came from a member of the Africa Lead team who is a cocoa expert and former executive of Mars Company. He has a relationship with Hershey executives to whom he introduced the possibility of partnership to provide experiential learning opportunities to mid-level to senior African agriculture and agribusiness professionals.</p>
                           <p>Initial contact with Hershey began with the head of their Commodities Operation and expanded to include the Director of Cocoa Risk Management. Throughout the development of the working relationship, exploration of the internship program and setting of parameters and logistical details, both were involved. Both were also involved in the vetting of potential interns, with the ECX&rsquo;s Manager of Inspection ultimately being selected for a 7 week placement at the Hershey headquarters in Hershey, PA, starting in February 2012.</p>
                           <p>Despite the fact that Hershey does not deal in the primary commodity handled in the ECX, coffee, also Ethiopia&rsquo;s primary export commodity, the aim of the internship was to expose the ECX Manager to how a processor of agricultural commodities uses commodities markets, spot and futures markets, to manage its price and commercial risk.</p>
                           <p>At the time of the internship the ECX had been mulling over how to start up a futures market operation in the main commodities traded on its floor, so this experience was particularly timely. Additionally, given that the ECX unlike most exchanges in the West, was developed in a top down rather than a bottom up (from traders) approach, Africa Lead believed it was of value for a representative of ECX to see what kind of services commodity exchanges are expected to provide to businesses for whom those commodities are important inputs.</p>
                           <p>&nbsp;</p>
                           <img src="img/experiential_rpm_coffee.png" class="image_right" style="height:350px" />
                           <p>&nbsp;</p>
                           <p>As a professional on exchange in the Commodities Operation of Hershey Company, the ECX representative was tightly integrated into virtually all activities of the group, including phone calls with agents around the world. During her 7 weeks in the Hershey offices, she sat with each commodity buyer/trader to gain each one&rsquo;s insights about activities in Commodity Operations. She attended biweekly and monthly meetings during which traders give commodity situation reports including their recommendations of Hershey&rsquo;s best strategy for the particular commodity and the period in question. Additionally, she attended cocoa product unit meetings and participated in conference callas with other departments, outlying plants, suppliers and other external business dealings, thereby gaining a broad understanding of the centrality of the Commodities Operation unit and how it provides information and strategic guidance to the rest of the company.</p>
                           <p>The ECX representative was also given substantial exposure to other Hershey Company departments including Corporate Social Responsibility; Strategic Sourcing Unit; Responsible Sourcing; and Security and Quality Standards team.</p>
                           <p>Supported directly by Hershey Company, she visited Hershey&rsquo;s Technical Center (R&amp;D), its product warehouse (Allen distribution), finished product warehouse (EDC III), and the Lancaster plant.&nbsp; Outside of Hershey units, she was accompanied by Hershey colleagues in visits to (1) the RPM coffee bean warehouse, New Jersey; (2) ICE Futures U.S. Inc.; and GENCO (General Cocoa Company, a division of coffee America (USA) Corporation).</p>
                           <p>The main lessons the ECX representative learned from the internship include:</p>
                           <ul>
                              <li>A basic understanding of global supply chain operation</li>
                              <li>The importance of using commodity futures markets to manage price risk</li>
                              <li>How to analyze market factors</li>
                              <li>Execution of futures electronically or through brokers</li>
                           </ul>
                           <p>The partnership with Hershey Company&rsquo;s Commodities Operation and additional personal connections to executives in the Research and Development department of Hershey led Africa Lead to begin discussions with R&amp;D on possible future B2B exchanges in that division, which would focus on product development, product safety and other skills and techniques increasingly important in a rapidly urbanizing Africa. To date, these have not materialized in specific placements as the program&rsquo;s key interlocutor in the R&amp;D department retired before the first internship came to fruition; none of his colleagues has been able to continue the program.</p>
                           <h2>Programs with Johannesburg Stock Exchange</h2>
                           <p>The internship program with Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) was housed in the Commodity Derivatives Division under the oversight of its Director. It was the first of the senior internship programs in which there are multiple interns who essentially engage in the same learning experience.</p>
                           <p>Four agribusiness professionals from East and Southern Africa participated, one at a time, in this program:</p>
                           <ul>
                              <li>Chief Executive Officer of East Africa Grains Council (EAGC)</li>
                              <li>Chief Strategy Officer, Ethiopia Commodity Exchange (ECX)</li>
                              <li>Executive Director of Zambian Commodity Exchange (ZAMACE)</li>
                              <li>Executive Director of Grain Traders Association of Zambia</li>
                           </ul>
                           <p>Each spent three weeks exposed to all aspects of grain trading on a commodities futures market, from storage to trading and currency issues. The objectives of the internship are primarily to understand the concepts of commodity exchanges, spot versus futures markets, futures derivatives versus options, to experience a live trading and operations environment, gain insights on setting up an exchange, and to meet, interact with and establish contacts with JSE. East African grain traders are keen to establish more robust and connected grain trading, including futures markets, and this sort of contact with a private-sector based and well established market is beneficial.</p>

                           <p>One intern mentioned spending time &ldquo;experiencing the live operations of the Commodity Derivatives&hellip;system and getting a hands-on appreciation of the day to day operations of the trading, clearing and settlement, the transfer of receipts and facilitation of delivery&hellip; understanding the key outputs of a trading day such as the mark-to-market (M-T-M) calculation for all contracts. The M-T-M forms the basis for the evaluation of all contracts traded for the day and hence the basis for the variation margins to be paid by owing brokers to their clearing banks.&rdquo;</p>
                           <p>He also mentioned that upon his return to Zambia he intended to promote, among others, development of a commodities futures market to complement ZAMACE&rsquo;s spot market, technical assistance from JSE to ZAMACE on the modeling of the exchange, rules and regulations and training of stakeholders such as the financial sector so they can better support a nascent futures exchange, and harmonization of ZAMACE&rsquo;s rules and regulations to permit easier collaboration with JSE.</p>
                           <p>Later some of these same senior interns participated in a JSE-sponsored event on futures markets in Africa, the Association of Futures Markets (AFM) Conference, which took place in Johannesburg from February 27 &ndash; March 1, 2013.</p>
                           <h2>Programs with Zamindara Farm Solutions</h2>
                           <p>The third senior internship program or B2B Exchange was with Zamindara Farm Solutions in Fazilka, a regional agricultural center in the Punjab region of India.</p>
                           <blockquote>

                           </blockquote>
                           <p>The immersion experience of these B2B exchanges produced added value through hands-on engagement with multiple manufacturers of machinery, operators in grain markets where paddy rice is collected and sold, local rice mill operators that purchase, process and package paddy rice for wholesale, a biomass power plant operator who uses farm wastes to generate electricity which is then sold to the government power grid, and the Industrial Training Institute in Fazilka where students are trained in various technical disciplines.</p>
                           <p>Being on-site allows the African agricultural entrepreneurs to engage directly with Zamindara&rsquo;s business partners, who lease tractors from the company and then rent them out to farmers based in local communities. This community-based model offers insights on how farmers adapt to mechanization. They also learn the importance of ensuring the equipment&rsquo;s maintenance and servicing.</p>
                           <p>This internship program is unique for a number of reasons one of which is that the three week program includes a three person team of senior interns.</p>
                           <p>Like JSE, the program with Zamindara was repeated. Africa Lead provided this learning experience to six agribusiness entrepreneurs in two groups of three.&nbsp; All senior interns focus on farm machinery sales, leasing and rental challenges in their home countries.</p>

                           <h2>Cuttington University, Liberia/Agriculture Show Studiy Visits to Kenya and Ghana Agricultural Trade Fairs (AGRIFA)</h2>
                           <p>In April 2011, the Cuttington University College of Agriculture and Integrated Development Studies (CU-CAIDS) of Liberia implemented the first Cuttington Agricultural Show adopting the theme &ldquo;Promoting Peace through Farming&rdquo;. The show was designed to demonstrate best practices for increasing agricultural production in Bong County, Liberia through partnerships among CAIDS students, farmers, NGOs and the government, particularly the Ministries of Agriculture and Internal affairs.</p>
                           <p>Africa Lead funded the participation of a team of three Liberians representing the planning committee the 2012 Cuttington in Liberia including a representative from the Ministry of Agriculture and the private sector to attend the 2011 AGRIFA trade fairs in Kenya and Ghana.</p>
                           <p>The objective of this exchange activity is to enhance the skills and capabilities of the team of Liberians in order to improve the performance standard for the 2012 Cuttington agriculture show, and other shows to be organized in the near future in the country.&nbsp;</p>
                           <p>The AGRIFA trade fair organizers served as the host for this exchange, providing administrative and technical support to the team as well as guidance and recommendations to aid in the preparation for the 2012 Cuttington show and other future shows in Liberia.</p>
                           <p>Topics to be covered during the internship included:&nbsp;</p>
                           <ul>
                              <li>Organizing team/committee structures - roles and responsibilities</li>
                              <li>Content of the fair, i.e., how to establish the show&rsquo;s vision/identity; types of exhibitors and other activities to attract participation&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                              <li>Planning horizon time lines</li>
                              <li>Successful implementation fair strategies</li>
                              <li>Financing &amp; Fund raising</li>
                              <li>Advertizing and show promotions</li>
                              <li>Public-Private Partnerships</li>
                              <li>Lessons Learned</li>
                           </ul>
                           <p>&nbsp;</p>
                           <p>AGRIFA developed a program of activities and learning experiences for the team for duration of the internship period which included participation in AGRIFA fair committee planning meetings, work/learning assignments before and during the AGRIFA fair and assistance in developing a strategy and updating their plan for the 2012 Cuttington Agriculture Show.</p>
                           <p>&nbsp;</p>
                           <p>The three senior interns from Liberia applied the experience gained from participating in the 2011 Nairobi International Show to assist the organizers and planners at Cuttington to design the 2012 Cuttington Agriculture Show and other future shows in Liberia with best practices derived from AGRIFA&rsquo;s example of public - private partnership with the private sector driving the organization and management of the show.</p>
                           <h2>Programs with Mars Co.</h2>
                           <p>Africa Lead designed and delivered the internship program with Mars Co. relatively late in the life of the project, but it has resulted in a request on the part of Mars for future interns, with a preference for cohorts of two interns at a time. Mars has made this request on the assumption that having more than one intern would allow for mutual support especially for individuals coming to the US for the first time and residing in a rural locale with limited transportation options.</p>
                           <p>The internship was for 8 weeks at the Mars Company&rsquo;s Uncle Ben&rsquo;s Rice facility in Greenville, Mississippi which processes and packages a large variety of dry meals and &lsquo;Ready to Heat Rice&rsquo;. The intern is the product development manager for a Ugandan food processing where she is responsible for drawing product road maps, managing product life cycles, developing new product ideas and ensuring quality and safety of all our products.&nbsp; The company works with various farmer associations each with its own supply value chain to produce nutritious, safe and healthy foods that address some of the nutritional problems prevalent in Uganda.</p>
                           <blockquote style="float:right">
                              “Like the Mars Food logo states, Better Food Today and Better World.  When food safety is achieved, we have a strong, healthy, and disease free generation that automatically translates into increased agricultural productivity, more food which is nutritious and safe and hence attaining our ultimate goal of food security.  It’s a challenge but with the great exposure, support and training I have had, I believe I can lead the change I want to see in food safety and food security. It’s all about passion, taking a lead and creating a difference however small it may be as long as it creates an impact.”
                              <cite>Uncle Ben’s Rice Intern</cite>
                           </blockquote>
                           <p>In comparison to Mars foods where quality and safety of the consumer is a guiding principle, priority and driving force, most food processing companies in Uganda produce low quality and unsafe products sold cheaply to poor people.&nbsp; The intern was assigned to the Quality &amp; Food Safety program where she gained hands-on learning experience participating in the program&rsquo;s quality audits conducted to ensure compliance of factory practices. She also observed the application of any necessary corrective actions imposed by the Quality and Food Safety program and the development of recommendations to continuously improve the food safety system.</p>
                           <p>The Ugandan product development manager participated in the audit of major suppliers, was able to visit and learn about Mars&rsquo; quality and food safety processes, technologies and equipment, and participated in a number of relevant trainings including: Good Manufacturing Practices, Associate Safety, Good Hygiene and Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) &ndash; for which she is now also a certified trainer.&nbsp;</p>
                           <p><img src="img/experiential_uncleben.png" class="image_left" style="height:350px" /></p>
                           <p>Close to the end of the B2B exchange, The intern and her company mentor traveled to Washington, DC to meet with Africa Lead and with USAID personnel where she made presentations on her internship. &nbsp;As a result of the experience, she expresses confidence that she will be able to apply what she had learned to improve the food quality and safety in her workplace.&nbsp; In addition she is looking forward to supporting local food producers in Uganda to add value to their products through product development, quality control, commercialization and marketing of the products and product management. She is planning specifically to reassess the food quality and safety situation at her company, looking at the current practices in place and identifying gaps with HAACP.</p>
                           <h2>Partnership with Sokoine University of Agriculture</h2>
                           <p>Sokoine University of Agriculture (SUA), a university founded by the government of Tanzania in partnership with USAID in 1961, has an innovative agribusiness program. It remains today the only higher education institution in Tanzania that concentrates on the field of agriculture, offering degrees on cooperative and business studies among a total of 30 undergraduate and 45 postgraduate degree programs.</p>
                           <p>At the request of USAID/Tanzania, Africa Lead engaged with SUA&rsquo;s Department of Agricultural Economics and Agribusiness in applying their studies to agricultural business development through a hands-on practicum. SUA graduates are provided assistance in developing business plans that are then submitted for for USAID-funded credit guarantee financing.&nbsp; Africa Lead matches their specific goals to company placements thus facilitating achievement of the objectives they set.</p>
                           <p>Some seek expertise in management and finance, others in marketing and procurement.&nbsp; Some are specifically interested in quality control or human resources.&nbsp; Others are focused on food processing or on packaging and branding.&nbsp; Several of the participants have set very strategic milestones for acquiring land or capital, setting up systems, and establishing efficient relationships with smallholder producers.</p>
                           <p>The leadership qualities of these young professionals are further on display in the formation of Sokoine University Graduate Entrepreneurs Cooperative Limited-SUGECO.&nbsp; This self-selected Society of agri-busness developers has formed for students to undertake extra training curriculum on self-employment, transfer knowledge and technology, incubate new businesses, forge alliances to reduce transaction costs and access broader markets, improve access to finance and generate capital through a saving and credit system and shares in investments in low risk funds.</p>
                           <p>&nbsp;</p>
                           <p>The businesses that are hosting the SUA interns are equally benefitting from the experience.&nbsp; Olam, one of the world&rsquo;s largest agricultural commodity traders, has so far sponsored two interns.&nbsp; According to the Executive Director and Board Member of the US$12.5 billion corporation: <em>&ldquo;</em><em>One of them is gone to set up a buying operation of coffee in another geography which we plan to do later this year so he has to come back with a biz plan and another intern has learned how to process cashews so will now study the local market and come back to us how to penetrate the market profitably.&rdquo;</em></p>
                           <h1>Conclusions and Lessons Learned</h1>
                           <p>The senior internship program, alternatively called the Agribusiness Leadership Program, and Business-to-Business (B2B) Exchange, has been an exceptionally difficult challenge to name appropriately. This challenge to capture the essence of the initiative in a useable term is instructive in terms of lessons learned because it captures some real tensions about the program.</p>
                           <p>The target of the senior internship program is mid-to-senior level executives of farms, ranches or agribusiness entities. There has been considerable discussion about what these &ldquo;interns&rdquo; should be called since they are not at all like typical student interns in which most of the information and technology flow is from host to student and in many cases the internship is being used to &ldquo;try out&rdquo; potential new hires.</p>
                           <p>In the case of the Agribusiness Leadership Program or B2B Exchanges, Africa Lead believes that there has been strong mutual benefit to both the intern and leadership of the host organization.</p>
                           <h2>General Lessons</h2>
                           <p>A number of general lessons have arisen from the design and implementation of Africa Lead internships.</p>
                           <p>First, there is a substantial amount of &ldquo;up-front&rdquo; cost in terms of time that needs to be spent to develop working relationships and agreements with host organizations. As a consequence, for efficiency sake it is good to seek arrangements with organizations that are likely to be willing to offer opportunities for more than one intern. This way the initial investment in time and other resources to develop the relationship and the hosting agreement can be spread over multiple interns.&nbsp; This worked successfully most notably with the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) and with Zamindara Farm Solutions.</p>
                           <p>A second is that there is always a bit of a &ldquo;chicken-and-egg&rdquo; situation with each potential internship arrangement.&nbsp; Does one start first with possible interns and find hosts that fit the needs of the interns or does one find companies that are willing to host African interns (especially senior staff who may be less likely to be potential future hires)? The Africa Lead internship team has decided that the first step is to determine the broad nature of themes that have most resonance in African Feed the Future countries, then to identify host companies and interns at essentially the same time.&nbsp; There is, however, a tendency to identify and bring on board the host companies first and then to work with designated representatives of those companies to identify interns most likely to benefit from the program, skills and experiences of those host companies.</p>
                           <p>It is helpful to as much as possible retain consistency in the points of contact between the funding organization (Africa Lead) and the potential host organization. With a consistent point of contact trust and understanding between organizations are enhanced; trust that the funding organization has serious intent and is not going to be wasting the time of busy corporate officers and understanding on the part of the potential host organization of what the funding organization&rsquo;s &ldquo;ask&rdquo; is.</p>
                           <p>&nbsp;</p>
                           <p>A third lesson is: Getting to yes.&nbsp; Among other challenges to developing internship programs for senior to mid-level staff in African enterprises to work within other enterprises is the question of how &ldquo;trade secrets&rdquo; or other sensitive information is handled. Depending on the position, size and nature of business of the &ldquo;sending&rdquo; organization, the host organization representatives have expressed varying levels of concern about this matter.</p>
                           <p>One further lesson is how the absence of a formal way of tracking the impact of internships may be hindering the continuity and expansion of the relationships with both host and home organizations.&nbsp; These exchanges have taken place mostly in the latter two years of the project.&nbsp; While it may be premature to measure &ldquo;impact&rsquo;, the internships have not have the same rigorous emphasis on action plans and commitment to implementation that characterizes the other training activities of Africa Lead.&nbsp; Therefore there are no benchmarks to follow.&nbsp; Nor have either the home or host organizations been polled for what value they see in the experience.</p>
                           <h1>Looking Forward</h1>
                           <p>Under situations of scarce resources, clearly the case with USAID funding, the question of where best to use those resources is both natural and correct. The way the question has been framed in relation to the internship programs is whether it makes more sense to invest as much as $15,000-$25,000 on an individual experiential learning exercise than to invest that same amount in smaller amounts on a range of capacity building programs for a larger number of people.</p>
                           <p>This is not an easy question to answer, for sure, and one answer might be that &ldquo;it depends.&rdquo; The better answer has to address what is it that the $15,000-$25,000 investment is seeking to help bring about.&nbsp; To this end, a more formal monitoring and evaluation component can provide more demonstrable value.</p>
                           <p>In the context of Africa Lead, Feed the Future, CAADP and National Agricultural Investment Plans the answer is the transformation of agriculture from its low input low output current state to a high productivity, innovative, employment generating future state. In that context what needs to be answered is what is most likely to bring about innovation. The internship program is built on the assumption that agri-entrepreneurs facing a particular technological, commercial or management challenge are ripe to innovate if only they can find some examples of ways to address those challenges. The program seeks to match the interns seeking an innovation with the hosts with the elements conducive to that innovation.</p>
                           <p>Thus the argument of Africa Lead is that it is possible that an apparently large individual investment in an individual agri-entrepreneur&rsquo;s attempt to solve a business problem can yield agricultural productivity and food security benefits that are many multiples of the dollar amount invested.</p>
                           <p>As a professor of management at the University of Michigan puts it in an article in FreshMIX &ldquo;daily dispatches from the management vanguard,&rdquo;<a href="http://www.managementexchange.com/blog/why-innovation-so-hard%E2%80%94and-how-get-better-it" target="_blank">&loz;</a> <em>&ldquo;Innovation happens from the outside in,&rdquo; </em>meaning that there has to be a break from the normal day-to-day activities of individuals in an organization, activities that are admittedly vital to getting current jobs done.</p>
                           <p>Innovation comes from the new exchanges, outside influences.&nbsp; As the article further notes: <em>&ldquo;&hellip;innovation is produced through variation.&rdquo;</em> Variation is what the Africa Lead senior interns get in their Business-to-Business exchanges. &nbsp;As the author of this report likes to put it, <em>&ldquo;To get my work done I need to stay in my office, but to get new ideas, I need to get out of my office.&rdquo;</em></p>
                           <p>The challenge to any follow on projects that will engage in senior internship programming for Business-to-Business exchanges will be picking the right combination of interns and hosts to ensure that the technical and other exchanges that take place provide the innovative breakthrough that the intern needs and also provides new insights to leaders in the host organization on how it might approach working with African partners in the medium to longer-term.</p>
                           <p>A Business-to-Business initiative of a larger size in dollar terms as well as in the number of interns supported present an opportunity for an Innovation Forum in which the interns share thoughts with USAID, with host companies and with one another on how innovation is best fostered through programs like these.</p>
                           <p>Going forward, Africa Lead would also suggest that each intern have a chance to have a meeting with Innovation Systems Experts such as Harvard Kennedy School&rsquo;s Professor Calestous Juma, Professor of the Practice of International Development Director, Science, Technology, Globalization, and the Faculty Chair of Innovation for Economic Development executive program also at Harvard. &nbsp;</p>

                           <p><strong>For [Host Company] &amp; DAI </strong></p>
                           <p><strong>Participation in the Agribusiness Leadership Program </strong></p>
                           <p>&nbsp;</p>
                           <p>DAI greatly appreciates the offer by [Host Company] to participate in the initial phase of USAID&#39;s African Agribusiness Leadership program. DAI is very encouraged to find that [Host Company] believes that Africa&#39;s future food security is dependent on the development of a robust and modern agribusiness sector.</p>
                           <p>This program is being implemented by Africa Lead, the USAID Feed the Future funded capacity building and training project, in support of the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Program (CAADP). The program goal is to transfer appropriate agricultural, agribusiness and agro-industrial practices from host companies to beneficiaries to assist African companies in improving business performance and ultimately food security. The program addresses the limiting constraints to increasing the quantity, quality, and choice of food, and reducing costs to consumers through improved production, marketing and trade related efficiencies.</p>
                           <p>The purpose of this MOU is to confirm the intent of [Host Company] to support the African Agribusiness Leaders program through the application of specially designed and experienced based training assignments.

                           <p>On behalf of the Africa Lead project, DAI confirms its intent to assist in the selection of candidates for these assignments. DAI will seek highly committed, qualified agribusiness professionals to participate in these training programs. This search will be directed through DAI&rsquo;s two regional offices for Africa Lead staffed by Regional Deputy Chiefs of Party (DCOPs). The DCOPs &ndash; for West Africa (Accra, Ghana), and for East and Southern Africa (Nairobi, Kenya) - will lead the search for qualified candidates, working with the relevant USAID missions and consulting with agribusiness associations in their regions. Through the Africa Lead program the DCOPs have delivered a number of training sessions to public and private sector stakeholders throughout their regions. These training participants comprise a pool of candidates as well as a source of referrals to other candidates.</p>
                           <p>The Africa Lead project Bethesda, MD-based home office staff will work with the DCOPs to vet candidates and select three to five whose qualifications and experience best match [Host Company&rsquo;s] training assignment. DAI will then submit these CVs to [Host Company] for final vetting and selection. However, if these candidates do not satisfy [Host Company&rsquo;s] selection criteria, DAI will conduct additional candidate screening.</p>
                           <p>Other support that DAI will provide the candidate(s) for this program includes the following:</p>
                           <ul>
                              <li>All international and local travel costs</li>
                              <li>Per diem expenses for housing, food, and incidentals</li>
                              <li>Assistance with visas and other travel documents</li>

                                <p>The purpose of this component of the project is to conduct institutional assessments of African institutions that are critical to Comprehensive African Agricultural Development Programme (CAADP) and to improving food security in Africa. The assessments are conducted through a diagnostic process, which seeks to accomplish the following:</a></p>

                                <ul>
                                  <li>Assess the key management, structural and operational attributes of an organization to determine its strengths and weaknesses;</li>
                                  <li>Identify organizational development needs and priorities; and</li>
                                  <li>Develop a plan to address shortcomings and strengthen organizational management and performance.</li>
                                </ul>

                              </blockquote>

                                <p>This activity of Africa Lead has completed fifty-four demand-driven institutional assessments at the request of USAID/BFS and USAID Missions.&nbsp;</p>

                                <p>The assessment process reviews issues of:</p>

                                <ul>
                                  <li>governance</li>
                                  <li>operations management and support</li>
                                  <li>data availability and analysis</li>
                                  <li>management and monitoring systems</li>
                                  <li>network building, and</li>

                                <p>&nbsp;</p>

                                <p>Key process and managerial skills identified in the CAADP Capacity Development Framework are also incorporated into the assessment process.</p>

                                <p>&nbsp;</p>

                                <p>Africa Lead has relied on and developed several methodologies for conducting organizational assessments. The particular assessment methodology used varies depending on the nature of the organizations. For example, somewhat different methodologies are used for CAADP country coordination programs, independent non-profit organizations, and Regional Economic Communities. In general, however, the same institutional functional capacity areas are reviewed under each assessment. These capacity areas include: governance; leadership; planning, including strategic and annual work planning; data analysis and results reporting; financial management and financial viability; staffing structures in relation to programs and mission; and management systems, including personnel and administrative management.&nbsp;</p>

                                <p>The following types of institutional capacity assessments have been conducted by the Africa Lead Project:</p>

                                <p>1) detailed assessments of individual institutions;<br />
                                2) assessments of the CAADP process and of CAADP coordination units;<br />
                                3) program-wide area assessments: and<br />
                                4) Institutional Architecture for Food Security Policy Change assessments.&nbsp;</p>

                                <p>The assessments of the CAADP process focus on the role, the management systems, and the capabilities of national coordination committees, sometimes referred to as task forces. Assessments and reviews of the CAADP coordination process have been conducted in Ethiopia, Ghana, Niger, Nigeria and Tanzania.&nbsp; The objectives of these assessments were to: (1) identify institutions and define organizational roles in relation to the achievement of NAIP objectives; and (2) identify institutional development needs, which include funding, personnel, skills and system development needs. These assessments vary somewhat from detailed institutional assessments in that they are primarily focused on analyzing the <strong>coordination</strong> role required to foster collaboration among a wide variety of organizations in order to achieve NAIP and CAADP objectives.&nbsp;</p>

                                <h2>Findings and Recommendations</a></h2>

                                <h3>Individual Institutions</a></h3>

                                <ul>
                                  <li>There is inadequate use of results-based management systems.&nbsp;</li>
                                  <li>Organizations can benefit from developing clear program objectives and performance indicators, and using performance monitoring and reporting systems to review performance and improve program management. Causality models of objectives are not widely used within the institutions assessed, which make it difficult to monitor and assess program effectiveness. A first step to strengthening program planning and monitoring is to provide training in strategic planning and help institutions develop medium-term results-based strategic plans. This assistance should be followed-up with training and technical assistance to develop robust performance monitoring and reporting systems.</li>
                                  <li>Workforce development/human resource management systems need strengthening. There is a gamut of common issues in these areas, which include: the need to better align staff positions and skills with organizational objectives; improved systems for providing training and skills development; and the identification of the competencies that are required to perform tasks and advance to higher positions within the organization.</li>
                                  <li>Information, Communication and Technology systems need updating and improvement, including knowledge management systems. While important for all institutions, this is particularly important for research and regional institutions. There is a need to upgrade information technology infrastructure, train staff in knowledge management, and use communication technology to effectively to share information and foster dialogue.</li>
                                  <li>Institutional assessments should be used as a basis for prioritizing and offering program-wide training and support. Training, and follow up technical assistance, should be offered in strategic planning, monitoring and evaluation, results-based management, knowledge management, fund-raising, and outreach and communications.</li>
                                  <li>Training and technical assistance is needed to strengthen the participation and capabilities of civil society and private sector associations. Organizations should be provided support to strengthen their membership-building and outreach, and their ability to engage on policy issues, which includes improving skills in the areas of policy analysis and advocacy.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <h3>CAADP Country Coordination Units</a></h3>

                                <ul>
                                  <li>High-level government support is critical to CAADP success. The CAADP programs that have advanced the furthest in terms of implementation are those that have received consistent high-level political support. This sets the tone for the program, and also permits cross-ministerial decision-making, coordination and resource sharing &ndash; all of which is required for food security programs to succeed. CAADP&rsquo;s oversight and coordination should, at a minimum, be directed by the Minister of Agriculture; however, it is more advantageous to have the program coordinated by someone with an authority to influence program priorities and spending across ministries.</li>
                                  <li>National food security priorities should be in alignment with donor programs. The CAADP coordinating committee should be closely linked to government-donor coordination so program objectives, budget allocations, reporting measures, and review processes are aligned.</li>
                                  <li>Detailed and aligned implementation plans are required. NAIPs are useful documents for outlining broad priorities, but they often lack the detail that is required to implement, manage and oversee programs at an operational level. To effectively implement NAIPs, the implementation activities need to be stepped-down to become the work plans of individual operating units, such as Ministry of Agriculture directorates. Plans should contain specific objectives, targets and performance measures. Performance data and measures at the directorate level should contribute to the measures used to assess a country&rsquo;s overall food security objectives.</li>
                                  <li>Task forces/working groups are required to develop CAADP implementation plans, and to move forward policy reforms. Higher-level committees are required to develop broad objectives, and to coordinate among and between programs, but in order to produce the detailed work and plans required to implement programs working-level groups are required. There are a&nbsp; variety of models for how this is being done, which include: establishing temporary committees around solving a specific issue or policy challenge, and disbanding the committee once the tasks is finished; setting up permanent working-level committees in support of specific objectives, and with the participation of directorate leaders; or creating private sector led task forces to recommend policy reforms and technical support priorities to committees lead by high-level government officials. Work groups have been used to produce analysis, undertake evaluations, design programs and write funding proposals.</li>
                                  <li>Private sector participation remains a challenge for many CAADP teams and private sector participation is low in most CAADP programs. There is a variety of reasons for this, including: private sector associations often seem minimally staffed; there is insufficient capacity to conduct analysis and develop policy positions; there is a lack of opportunity to meaningfully participate in and influence government program and policy discussions; and because the private sector has limited time available to participate in lengthy or multi-day workshops, or meetings that are not well-focused on a topic of direct interest. Kenya and Rwanda provide examples of successful approaches to developing private sector-led working groups to address the challenges of NAIP implementation.</li>
                                  <li>The AU/CAADP should provide additional assistance to countries in how to strengthen NAIP implementation. Assistance in this area could include: establishing and building the capacities of work groups to plan and oversee program design and management; create work groups that are empowered and have the capacity to promote specific policy reforms/bottlenecks (as Rwanda has done); and develop and disseminate tools for use by CAADP oversight committees, including stepped-down planning tools, performance measures, and standard monitoring frameworks. It would be useful to develop a set of Standard Operating Procedures for CAADP coordination committees and to provide training in support of the key required functions.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <h1>Institutional Capacity Assessment: Institutional Architecture for Food Security Policy Change</a></h1>

                                <p>Africa LEAD developed the Institutional Architecture for Food Security Policy Change assessment methodology (IAA) in early 2013 and to date has completed seven country-level analyses. The purpose of these assessments has been to determine a country&rsquo;s capacity to undertake food security policy reform. These assessments have been undertaken to provide the USAID Bureau of Food Security, USAID Missions, local policymakers, and other key stakeholders with information on constraints that stymie effective policy reform.</p>

                                
                                <p><img src="img/assessments_policyreform.png" class="image_right"  id="assessments_policyreform"  style="height:250px" /></p>

                                <p>Once completed, the analysis can be used to design technical assistance and other support to address constraints and improve the policy reform capacity. The assessments focus on areas of transparency, predictability, inclusiveness and evidence-based analysis, and mutual accountability.</p>

                                <p>Institutional architecture for food security policy assessments have been completed for the following countries and institutions: Ethiopia, Ghana, Malawi, Mozambique, Rwanda and Tanzania.</p>

                                <h2>Overview and Methodology</a></h2>

                                <p>IAAs are intended to provide a quick review of the main components and actors that typically have a central role to play in a country&rsquo;s food security policy change process. The assessments always review the role of the ministry of agriculture, and quite often focus on the ministry&rsquo;s policy coordination unit. The assessments also review the role of other policy-related government institutions, such as the Prime Minister&rsquo;s office, the Parliament (e.g. sub-committee for agriculture), the Ministry of Finance, and various line Ministries, such as those responsible for rural roads and irrigation. In addition, the assessments examine the role and capacities of various civil society organizations to determine their participation and capacity in regard to developing or influencing food security policy. These organizations may include farmer-based organizations, commodity or producer organizations, women&rsquo;s organizations and private sector associations.</p>

                                <p>The IAA assessment methodology contains two main components: an <strong>institutional mapping process</strong>, which identifies the main institutions involved in a policy change process and how they relate to one another in regard to policy; and an assessment of a <strong>country&rsquo;s capacity to undertake food security policy reform</strong>, as per the main elements of a policy development or change process.</p>

                                <p>The policy change process has been divided into six elements, and for each element a series of indicators have been developed.&nbsp; These indicators define the characteristics that are required for each element to be successfully implemented.&nbsp;</p>

                                <p>The six policy change elements that are assessed are:</p>

                                <ul>
                                  <li>Policy Element 1: Predictability of the Guiding Policy Framework</li>
                                  <li>Policy Element 2: Policy Development and Coordination</li>
                                  <li>Policy Element 3: Inclusivity and Stakeholder Consultation</li>
                                  <li>Policy Element 4: Evidence-Based Analysis</li>
                                  <li>Policy Element 5: Policy Implementation</li>
                                  <li>Policy Element 6: Mutual Accountability</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p>The IAA methodology has been developed to have consistency with the principles of the CAADP Programme. CAADP principles that have been incorporated into the Africa Lead IAA assessment process include: the use of evidence-based analysis; inclusive and broad stakeholder participation in all aspects of the program, including planning and implementation; mutual accountability, which is consistent with the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness and has been adopted by the AU; and program and policy coordination, which focuses on the broad multi-sectoral nature of food security programming and management.</p>

                                <p>The assessment is primarily a <strong>qualitative</strong> process and ratings are provided on the general level of achievement for each indicator (within the six elements) using a three-color stoplight rating system. The meaning of the ratings is as follows:</p>

                                <ul>
                                  <li><strong>Red:</strong> The indicator requires significant attention to ensure the component is achieved.</li>
                                  <li><strong>Yellow:</strong> Progress is mixed. The conditions required to achieve the component are partially achieved, but additional attention is required.</li>
                                  <li><strong>Green:</strong> The indicator is realized to a sufficient degree, and additional attention to this area is not required at this time.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p>Narrative text is provided to support each rating. At the end of each of the &ldquo;policy element&rdquo; sections recommendations are provided that suggest assistance or process changes that can be undertaken to improve policy change capacity.</p>

                                <p>The assessments generally are completed in-country by a two-person team over a two week period. The details of the assessment process and methodology follow along with an analysis of what has been learned from the assessments conducted to date.</p>

                                <h2>Mapping of Institutional Architecture Inventory</a></h2>

                                <p>The first step in the assessment process is to map the key systems, processes, and relationships that influence food security policy development. This approach involves identifying and mapping the relationships among the following: the guiding policy framework; the key institutions that hold primary responsibility for policy implementation; inter-ministerial coordination mechanisms; and private and civil society organizations that impact and influence the food security policy change process.</p>

                                <p>The target stakeholders to be considered when conducting the assessment include:</p>

                                <p>The second part of the IAA assessment involves an analysis of a country&rsquo;s capacity to undertake transparent, inclusive, predictable, and evidence-based policy change. A country&rsquo;s capacity to manage policy change is examined through six components of the policy formulation process to determine its &lsquo;readiness&rsquo; for policy change.</p>

                                <p>Each of these components is analyzed by reviewing a set of indicators that determine the capacity and effectiveness of the overall policy change process. The indicators for each of the six policy elements are presented in a matrix as Appendix I. Each indicator is assessed using a three-tier rating system, which highlights the status of accomplishment to date in the achievement of indicators. An initial rating of indicators can serve as a baseline measure of a country&rsquo;s food security policy management capacity, and serves to highlight the areas of the policy change process that are most in need of strengthening.</p>

                                <h2>Recommendations</a></h2>

                                <p>The third part of the assessment is a succinct recommendations section.&nbsp; Recommendations are based on the findings that are used to rate individual indicators.&nbsp; The recommendations are action-oriented and brief, and highlight assistance that can be provided to strengthen a country&rsquo;s policy management capacity.</p>

                                <h3>Findings and Recommendations from Completed Country Assessments</a></h3>

                                <p>Lessons and recommendations learned from across all of the policy assessments are provided on:</p>

                                <p>1) common areas and themes relating to strengthening policy capacity across all countries;<br />
                                2) how to improve the policy capacity assessment process; and<br />
                                3) a presentation of select recommendations drawn from individual assessments as per each of the IAA&rsquo;s six elements.</p>

                                <h3>Policy Capacity Assessments: Africa LEAD Overall Findings</a></h3>

                                <p>To determine how different countries rated in terms of their overall capacities to manage a policy change process the stoplight scoring system &ndash; green, yellow and red ratings &ndash; have been  to number scores. By converting these scores to number it is possible to review the following for the countries that have undergone IAA assessments:</p>

                                <ul>
                                  <li>The relative strength of various countries&rsquo; capacities across the six policy change elements;</li>
                                  <li>How that capacity of individual countries relate to one another;</li>
                                  <li>Overall, and across countries, the policy elements that appear to be strongest, and those most in need of strengthening;</li>
                                  <li>The individual indicators of policy capacity (there are multiple indicators for each capacity element) that scored highest and lowest across the countries assessed.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p><em>Caveat lector</em>: In general, the scores for individual country assessments, and the elements and indicators provide an overview of the strength and weakness of policy change capacity for particular countries, and for elements and indicators across the countries scored. However, it is suggested this information be used as general assessment guidance and, when possible, considered along with other available information. The policy systems and change process can vary significantly from country to country, and can vary among policy reform processes within the same country &ndash; making direct comparisons from country to country somewhat inexact. In addition, it should be noted that the various elements and indicators are not weighted as to importance. And finally, while the ratings do produce comparative scores, the assessment process is primarily qualitative so it is not a scientifically objective process. Despite these concerns, we believe the analysis does provide useful guidance for helping to identify future technical assistance priorities.</p>

                                  <li><strong>As per IAA assessment ratings, Rwanda and Ethiopia appear to be the most advanced countries in terms of CAADP NAIP planning, management and implementation.</strong> The processes, tools and management structures used by these countries can be offered as examples to other countries to guide them in the development of their programs. This can be done through analyzing and sharing information, e.g., through case studies, and by supporting study tours for other countries to visit Rwanda and Ethiopia so as to learn from their achievements. The work of other countries should also be reviewed so that best practices can be identified and shared (in cases where individual indicator ratings are particularly high or when practices are innovative).</li>
                                </ul>

                                <ul>
                                  <li><strong>Countries involved in CAADP have generally done a good job in putting into place overall food security plans and frameworks.</strong> This can be attributed to the attention of CAADP to develop and peer-review NAIPs, and as a result of the extensive guidance and training and that has been developed in support of these processes.</li>
                                </ul>

                                  <li><strong>Promoting evidence-based analysis and inclusive stakeholder participation are the policy elements that appear to need the most support.</strong> In regard to evidence-based analysis, there is a need for additional trained staff, increased budgets, and the development of systems that enable evidence to be used in the policy development and review process. This is an area that is receiving considerable attention from a number of donors, and particularly by IFPRI/ReSAKKS, but additional effort is required.</li>

                                  <li><strong>Inclusiveness:</strong> In terms of the promotion of increased and inclusive participation in the food security policy development and review process, the following two issues require increased attention: (1) increased funding and improved capacity in the area of policy analysis (for government and non-government institutions); and (2) helping civil society organizations strengthen their advocacy and political influence, including through training to strengthen evidence-based policy analysis and promotion; strengthening coalition and membership building to increase political influence; and supporting increased policy advocacy capacity.</li>

                                  <li><strong>Mutual accountability:</strong> Basic and functioning mutual accountability systems exist, but private sector and CSO inclusion is minimal. In addition, the lack of data and analysis to assess policy effectiveness, and inadequate results monitoring systems, limits the utility accountability processes.</li>

                                <h2>Improving the Capacity for Policy Change Assessment Process</a></h2>

                                <p>The following lessons can help to improve the management of the IAA assessment process.</p>

                                <ul>
                                  <li><strong>Build commitment and involvement into the assessment process.</strong> Significant involvement of decision makers is required -- orientation briefings, workshops, and post-assessment briefings should be used. Senior host country decision makers need to be aware of the assessment process, and be committed to the process, if the results are to be considered and implemented.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p>&nbsp;</p>

                                <ul>
                                  <li><strong>Connect the assessment process to existing management structures.</strong> In all of the countries where the assessments were conducted existing forums exist for reviewing and reforming food security policy. To the extent possible, the assessment process should work within these structures to ensure capacity challenges are well understood and can be addressed. In cases when there is a lack of participation or capacity from among civil society organizations an effort should be made to increase participation opportunities, and to increase the capacity of such organizations to promote and defend specific reforms.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p>&nbsp;</p>

                                <ul>
                                  <li><strong>Develop mechanisms from the outset to address recommendations.</strong> Capacity improvement plans need to be supported with funding and assistance &ndash; otherwise the assessments become &ldquo;shelf-reports&rdquo; as there is not a mechanism, nor the will, to implement improvements. Shortly after an assessment is conducted the recommendations for how to increase policy change capacity should be reviewed and a technical assistance capacity improvement plan should be developed. Countries are more likely to value the assessment process if it leads to funded and direct actions to measurably improve policy change management capacity. This requires buy-in to the process by decision makers, and the provision of funds and technical support to enact needed improvements.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p>&nbsp;</p>

                                <ul>
                                  <li><strong>Develop standard assessment processes and train facilitators to ensure consistent reviews and quality.</strong> IAA assessments can be regularly conducted across countries to benchmark progress, highlight challenges, develop and communicate best practices, and to create capacity improvement plans. However, to be useful, the assessment process requires skilled facilitators and consistent application. A cadre of skilled facilitators should be developed to conduct these assessments.&nbsp; This will help to ensure consistent application quality, and begin to build broader acceptance for the use of the assessment process.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p>&nbsp;</p>

                                <ul>
                                  <li><strong>Use the IAA assessment process to benchmark capacity.</strong>&nbsp; The initial IAA assessments can provide a baseline of existing capacity.&nbsp; Once training and technical assistance have been provided to improve the status of individual indicators subsequent assessments can be used to measure progress achieved, e.g. moving indicator ratings from red to yellow.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <h2>Select Recommendations from the Individual Country Assessments, as per the Six Policy Elements</a></h2>

                                <p>Recommendations taken from individual country assessments that are common to one or more countries, or which seem to have applicability to more than one country are highlighted here. They can be used to identify technical assistance that may be useful to make available to multiple countries, e.g. these could be areas of training or technical assistance that could be offered by the AU or Africa Lead as a menu of assistance to all CAADP countries.</p>

                                <p>The full set of IAA country recommendations is presented as Appendix III - Recommendations from Institutional Architecture Policy Assessments, Organized by Policy Element and Country.</p>

                                  <li>Similar to the role of the Donor Coordinator in the DPP Office, there should be an office responsible for coordination vertically within the MAFC and horizontally across related Ministries on food security policy. As a priority, this office should be adequately resourced in terms of personnel and equipment. Within this office, there should be a position responsible for liaising with the private sector or its representative, e.g. ACT. (Tanzania)</li>

                                  <li>Develop a structure to manage the policy reform process.&nbsp; The management of the METASIP&rsquo;s policy reform process needs to be overseen and coordinated by a government entity or task force that can coordinate among multiple ministries, influence the political and budgetary decision-making process, and can ensure the active participation of a range of high-level decision makers.&nbsp; The current structure of the PPMED-led METASIP SC is too low in the administrative hierarchy to perform the tasks required to effectively manage the policy reform process, and they do not have the staff or resources required to manage the required work load. Other ministries responsible for key implementation actions contained in the METASIP need to have a more involved and a more prominent role.&nbsp; Ideally, overall coordination should be led by an entity that has the mandate to coordinate programs across ministries.</li>

Complementation strategies around diversification that align with the National Export Strategy focus on grain legumes and oilseeds require better integration and coordination of policy among the OPC, MoAFS, and MoIT. OPC may be the only location where functional interministerial coordination can occur; however, OPC and Ministries involved in ASWAp need comparable policy development capacities if policies are to be balanced among competing interests, so donor support should consider setting support targets accordingly among MoAFS, MoIWD, MoIT, and MLGRD and the OPC. Additional capacity at these levels will be needed to absorb the policy development and coordination (resource mobilization) requirements of podium directives so that medium term policy priorities are not neglected.</li>

                                  <li>Greater emphasis needs to be placed on the use of economic analysis and the required data sets in policy targeting, design and implementation.</li>
                                  <li>Linkages between independent policy analysis institutions (e.g. academic and research institutions) and policy makers should be strengthened to encourage more proactive policy research.</li>
                                  <li>Investments are needed to expand the technical staff and provide adequate infrastructure systems to support a monitoring and evaluation framework to monitor the accomplishment of the objectives, performance, impact and results.</li>

                                  <li>Collection of the routine data required to track and analyze impacts of food security policy and activities needs to rationalized and &lsquo;housed&rsquo; under one organization.&nbsp; Methodologies need to be confirmed and staff at the field level thoroughly trained to use them in collecting data. Resources need to be committed to ensure data quality and verification, returning feedback to the field and thereby establishing accountability.</li>
                                  <li>There was little indication that Government was taking full advantage of technology to rapidly collect and transmit data from the field to facilitate monitoring evolving food security and market situations. For example, currently available cellular technology with built-in geo-referencing capability could enhance LGA capacity to report near real time information on crop production conditions, prices and other valuable data to Ministry level colleagues for their use.</li>

One example would be to support advocacy to the OPC, MoAFS, and MOIT to commit to a schedule for the pre-planting season publication of cost of production methodology and data, the calculation elements and announcement of minimum prices before the planting season (if the government cannot be convinced to abandon the minimum price policy) with territorial adjustments, and procedures to ensure that market regulatory changes are announced with sufficient lead time for market participants to meet new requirements before the beginning of the marketing season in 2014.</li>

                            <h1>Introduction</h1>

                            <p>This project seeks to enhance and grow a database of short courses and Open Educational Resources (OER) offered by different institutions, which can be used to facilitate the ongoing development of agricultural professionals, students and other stakeholders working in the agricultural sector. The database of short courses of the &nbsp;Africa Lead Project was initially designed and implemented by Michigan State University.&nbsp; It was taken over by OER Africa which is at present hosting the database on a stand-alone server, for an African-wide programme. OER Africa, together with RUFORUM is responsible for overseeing the updating of the database on a regular basis.</p>

                            <p>The database is being publicized widely not only to graduates of the Africa Lead Champions for Change courses but to many other high ranking personnel in government positions, faculty, non-governmental organizations and other interested persons. The Champions for Change programme seeks to build the capacity of agriculture leaders to prioritize activities and implement Regional and Country Agriculture Investment Plans within the CAADP framework. The database serves as a valuable resource that will ensure that some of the courses offered by Africa&rsquo;s finest agricultural institutions and many in America, Europe and worldwide will be rendered highly visible, to ensure their widespread dissemination and usage.</p>

                            <p>Beginning December 2012, OER Africa in conjunction with RUFORUM, the Regional Universities Forum for Capacity Building in Agriculture, trained staff and students at 19 universities across Eastern and Southern Africa (in Ethiopia, Kenya, Lesotho, Uganda, Tanzania, Malawi, Zambia, Zimbabwe and Swaziland) in the use of the Africa Lead Database. This phase of the project aimed to introduce institutions to the database and to teach individuals there how to upload information about their course offerings and therefore increase their dissemination. A total of 25 institutions (in Kenya, Malawi, Tanzania, Uganda, Ethiopia, Lesotho, Swaziland, Mozambique , Rwanda and South Africa) were invited to participate. Only the South African institutions targeted by the project were not members of RUFORUM.&nbsp;</p>

                            <p>The training component of the project was implemented over 3 months (December 2013 to February 2013) with very tight timeframes that resulted in a series of challenges that speak to some of the overall lessons learnt. These are discussed later on in this brief report. However, despite the challenges faced this aspect of the project was successfully completed and the database base continues to grow steadily. With regards to implementation at the institutions, challenges mostly had to do with access to the internet and the use of old and incompatible software and hardware, but in general the project was well received. The targeting of the right institutional staff members was found to be critical in ensuring buy-in and participation.</p>

                            <h1>The graphic (a screen grab from the database) below gives an indication of some of the overall database statistics for the period 1 December 2012 to 30 September 2013.</h1>

                            <p>&nbsp;</p>

                            <p><img src="img/Lessons_graph1.png" class="image_right" id="Lessons_graph1" style="height:400px" /></p>

                            <p>It can be seen that over 3500 people have visited the database during the period 1 December 2012 to 30 September 2013 with 80.67% of the visits being first time ones and a return rate of 19.2%. The average visit duration was 3 minutes and 23 seconds. There is a bounce-rate of 60.88% which is rather high and needs further interrogation. The accessing of the database has been more or less consistent as shown by the graph above, however the number of courses newly uploaded at different times varied considerably with 444 being uploaded during the period December 2012 to February 2013, and then 93 and 131 new uploads over the next two time periods (March to June and then July to September 2013).&nbsp;</p>

                            <p>&nbsp;</p>

                            <p>The initial big difference in the new course uploads is probably due to the fact that the project team was actively involved in ensuring project milestones were achieved during the first time period. It was also the beginning of the academic year at many institutions and so they had their course offerings ready. Most visits to the site were from South Africa which may be linked to the fact that the top course providers are also from South Africa and Namibia.</p>

                            <p>Of the top 20 providers eight are higher education institutions whilst the rest consist of other training organizations involved in development. The top 20 course providers can be seen from the database screen grab in table 1 below. The majority of these providers serve institutions and individuals situated on the African continent however there were some from other countries such as the United States of America, United Kingdom and Malaysia. The number of course providers has increased steadily from 151 to 192 over the ten month period from December 2012 to September 2013.</p>

                            <h3>Lessons learnt</h3>

                            <p>Despite the challenges faced much was achieved within very tight and inflexible time-frames. However there are a few lessons learnt from the project that should be taken into consideration for the planning and implementation of future projects of this nature:</p>

                            <p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not all African higher education institution staff had regular access to internet or laptops or up-to-date software and so alternative ways had to be used in training them to learn about and use the database. In this regard, a simulation (online and offline) was developed and used to show people how to use the database by projecting pictures via a data projector. CDs and a training pamphlet were disseminated to all participants to support them in accessing and using the database after the initial training.</p>

                            <p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A template to collect course information was also developed that could be filled in easily on one&rsquo;s computer using a word processing package or could printed out for a person to complete manually, scan and submit. This sort of tool proved to very useful when training at sites where connectivity and access to suitable hardware and software was limited.</p>

                            <p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is important to <em>target the right people for the training</em> especially those tasked by their institutions to make their courses/programmes visible &ndash; in this way one contributes to ensuring the continuity, sustainability and growth of the database. At some institutions trainers felt that some of the beneficiaries sent for the training were not the right ones meaning that in the long run the institution would not benefit from the capacity being developed.</p>

                            <p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There were some challenges experienced in <em>identifying and getting permission for the right people to be trained</em> &ndash; in some instances the associated bureaucratic red-tape and hierarchical institutional protocol created bottlenecks, barriers and delays. These issues need to be taken into consideration up-front and also link directly to lesson 3 listed above</p>

                            <ol>
                              <li>Institutions have times of the year when it is <em>difficult to involve staff (especially academic staff) in training because of heavy work commitments</em> as well as the inclusion of extended holidays &ndash; project implementation happened during such a period and academic staff (whilst interested) were not as keen to take the time off to engage properly with the training and advocacy interventions. This needs to be taken into consideration when looking at future project implementation -- be it training, or general on-site advocacy.</li>
                              <li>Some <em>institutions were neither easily contactable nor accessible due to their geographical location</em>. Some thought has to be put into how best to reach and inform such institutions and get them to use and contribute to growing the database.</li>
                              <li>There is a <em>need for more flexibility or else lengthened project timeframes</em> to accommodate the inflexibility of the USAID travel regulations and the slow response times to travel permission requests &ndash; much as it is understood why they are necessary, one cannot then generally expect good project outcomes when working with higher education institutions that have their own particular time related challenges (as outlined in lessons 4 and 5 above; we were lucky that the partners had project members based in 3 different countries that somehow mitigated this challenge and introduced a slight element of flexibility.</li>
                              <li>Working with <em>RUFORUM as a partner was extremely beneficial and facilitated easier identification of and access to the participating institutions</em> and thus a better response was obtained from the RUFORUM member institutions as opposed to those that are not. Discussions held with the RUFORUM staff member that participated in institutional visits and training gave the following answers in response to the questions on the perceived <em>usefulness and sustainability of the database</em>:</li>
                            </ol>

                            <p>&nbsp;</p>

                            <p><strong>Question: In your opinion is the database useful?</strong></p>

                            <p><strong>Response:</strong><em> &nbsp;&nbsp; Yes. It is useful to RUFORUM and the network as a whole. It closely links to our Theory of Change by addressing one of our deliverables &ldquo;Dynamic Platform for University Networking, Advocacy for Agricultural Higher Education&rdquo;</em></p>

                            <p><strong>Question: What is the relevance of promoting professional development through short courses among your member universities? </strong></p>

                            <p><strong>Response:</strong><em> &nbsp;&nbsp; The approach gives publicity to the ongoing short professional courses offered. The universities I visited had ongoing short courses that would be relevant for sharing within the network but had no central place to host or advertise the courses, nor was there someone to push this content/information online. </em></p>

                            <p>&nbsp;</p>

                            <p><em>Secondly, RUFORUM is keen to see its member universities academic rankings increase. This can be partly achieved through the visibility of their course offerings online which then contributes to the improved the visibility of the network universities. </em></p>

                            <p><em>Thirdly, the RUFORUM secretariat holds short skills enhancement courses or retreats for its postgraduate students. The Africa Lead Database could be used to enhance how RUFORUM delivers these courses. RUFORUM would then focus on packaging them so they are accessible and visible online. &nbsp;</em></p>

                            <p>&nbsp;</p>

                            <p><strong>Question: <em>Where do you think the database should best be positioned or situated? </em></strong></p>

                            <p><strong>Response: &nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><em>I think given that the database serves to promote the universities content/course offerings and improve service delivery it would be best hosted by RUFORUM. We at RUFORUM see ourselves as having a platform that fosters collaboration between its member institutions. This also speaks well to our need to fulfill the dissemination aspect to the network of institutions.</em></p>

                            <p>&nbsp;</p>

                            <p><strong>Question: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How will what you have learned whilst implementing the project guide your work aimed at sustaining the database?</strong></p>

                            <p><strong>Response:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><em>Clearly, the database needs to be hosted and someone dedicated to improving its content on an ongoing basis to make sure the information about courses offered within the network is available online. This will require time and resources. Some course offerings only become available through physical visits to institutions and getting to understand whom to work with to get the relevant information online.</em></p>

                            <p>&nbsp;</p>

                            <p><strong>Question:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How did the grant provide catalytic help?</strong></p>

                            <p><strong>Response:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><em> It enabled capacity building through enabling the online training sessions and the physical visits. The skills attained were helpful and I am sure the website statistics also speak to this.</em></p>

                            <p>&nbsp;</p>

                            <p>OER Africa team members are in agreement with these sentiments. The following section looks at some recommendations regarding the ways in which the database might be made sustainable.</p>

                            <h3>Sustainability of the database &ndash; some recommendations</h3>

                            <p>There is a need to find a sustainable way of growing the database further (in a resource friendly way) through new course uploads and increasing the number of visits to it. This requires a multi-pronged approach.</p>

                            <ol>
                              <li>Encouraging continued institutional course uploads by:</li>
                            </ol>

                            <ul>
                              <li>sending regular reminders to individuals who underwent training and where possible</li>
                              <li>strategically targeting other individuals such as librarians, university marketing and short learning programme staff by email and phone to help get the message out there and collect the information required.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>This approach is likely to be more effective than trying to get academic staff members who are often extremely busy, to upload information on a regular basis.</p>

                            <ol>
                              <li>Identifying and then directly marketing the database to short course service providers inviting them to either upload course information or provide hyperlinks to the relevant information. &nbsp;</li>
                              <li>Advertising information about the database:
                              <ul>
                                <li>In the quarterly <em>Saide</em> online newsletter.</li>
                                <li>other suitable online spaces such as OER Africa&rsquo;s AgShare and the RUFORUM websites as well as on</li>
                                <li>institutional intranets (where possible).</li>
                              </ul>
                              </li>
                              <li>&nbsp;Strategically piggy-backing some of the future Africa Lead training and advocacy at institutions to other project visits by the partners - to leverage existing resource synergies. Such an approach could contribute to more resource friendly continuous dissemination and advocacy about the database.</li>
                              <li>Employing someone to spend a bit of time each month to:</li>
                            </ol>

                            <ul>
                              <li><em>Search for and upload new courses</em> of existing service providers on the database</li>
                              <li><em>Finding new service providers</em> (institutions and others) over and above the targeted ones &ndash; getting permission to upload their courses.&nbsp; A suitable template for capturing course information has been designed for this purpose. It can be sent out to the identified service providers who are then invited to provide course details that are then uploaded.</li>
                              <li><em>maintain the functionality of the database and its server</em></li>
                              <li>regularly <em>keep track of course uploads and database hits</em></li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>&nbsp;</p>

                            <p>This could possibly require additional financial resources however these costs could be paid for through cross-subsidization from related projects or aligning and embedding the database in either the OER Africa or RUFORUM spaces. However in order for this to be done in a sustainable way:</p>

                            <p>&nbsp;</p>

                            <ul>
                              <li>The database could be converted to a more suitable platform that would make for easier administration and management. For example: right now it is a stand-alone database - on the Wordpress platform, and has limited tools. This platform differs from that of both OER Africa (Drupal) and the RUFORUM repository (AgriDrupal) &ndash; these platforms have tools that would improve the usability and visibility of the database.</li>
                              <li>&nbsp;If the database were moved to the RUFORUM or OER Africa web-spaces it would mean all the available Agriculture open education resources and the short course information could be and accessed in one place.&nbsp;This would probably contribute to:<em> increased website functionality</em>, and <em>overall improved sustainability</em> as these two web spaces are visited regularly by various individuals. Linking it directly to the RUFORUM platform would be particularly strategic as RUFORUMs target beneficiaries are the same ones we would wish to use the database.</li>
                              <li>It has been estimated that such a conversion would take about 15 days.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This would also be a cost-effective approach as the tools required are already in the system and would improve database functionality. This would mean the database is no longer a stand-alone, which is a challenge at present because it means maintaining a separate platform that needs an extra set of resources.</li>
                              <li>At present there is also a high bounce rate and the database is not found that easily &ndash; this is attributed to the way the landing page is designed. There is a need to <em>improve the look and feel of the landing page</em> to mitigate the bounce rate.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <ol>
                              <li><em>Follow up contact and the provision of online and telephonic support of the staff at institutions</em> where training has taken place to encourage them to keep up with ongoing course uploads (as the courses become available) or to submit the information so that they can be uploaded for them</li>
                              <li>A <em>workshop training template</em> can be developed to support on-site training. This together with the <em>training simulation</em> designed to support staff involved in carrying out the database training can be circulated to those newly trained or introduced to the database, so that they can <em>continue training and provide support</em> at their institutions. These tools might need some revision if the database is shifted onto another platform.</li>
                            </ol>

                            <p>&nbsp;</p>

                            <h3>Conclusion</h3>

                            <p>The database is useful and can definitely contribute to ongoing professional development and capacity building. However, in order to encourage its continued growth there is a need to mitigate those factors that have been identified as impacting negatively on the database and its use. The lessons learnt and the recommendations made in this report can be used to further improve the database and contribute to its sustainability in the longer term.</p>
