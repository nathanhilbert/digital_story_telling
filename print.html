    The purpose of this report is to summarize and describe the USAID’s Africa Lead program and the four tasks that were implemented over the three year life of the program. This report is also written to both present the results and outcomes of the program as well as capture the main lessons that have been learned from the design, customization and implementation of Africa Lead’s tasks. 
                        </p>
                        <p>


    This report is structured by first presenting an overall summary of the Africa Lead program, its goals, objectives and operational structure. This is followed by a description of each of the four tasks providing an overview for each task with a description of the main activities that were implemented, along with the overall results and outcomes of the tasks. These sections are then followed by a discussion of the programmatic and operational lessons learned from throughout the program.

                    <h2 id="intro">Background and History of Project</h2>
                    <p>
Africa Lead is a program sponsored by the U.S. government’s Agency for International Development (USAID) which was designed to support the capacity building program of the US Government’s Feed the Future (FTF) Initiative, which aligns U.S. Government development assistance with Africa-owned agriculture development plans that are, in turn, aligned with the African Union’s Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Program (CAADP). CAADP seeks to contribute to the MDG goals by ensuring that governments throughout the continent apply 10% of their public budgets to agriculture in an effort to achieve the 6% annual growth in agricultural productivity that is needed to achieve sustainable food security throughout the continent.
                    </p>
                    <p>
Africa Lead is implemented by lead RAISE Plus IQC holder, DAI and supported by Management Systems International (MSI), Winrock International, Training Resources Group (TRG), ECI Africa Consulting (Pty) Ltd., and Michigan State University (MSU). Africa Lead operates across three regions in Sub-Saharan Africa from two offices. Working across public, civil society, university and private sector institutions, Africa Lead seeks to ensure that there are leaders trained to maintain a critical mass of food security “Champions” who will drive agriculture-led development by leading and implementing the Regional and National Agriculture Investment Plans within the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Program (<span class="infotip" data="Put info here">CAADP</span>) framework.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        When the project started it was implemented through three regional offices–Accra, Ghana; Nairobi, Kenya; and Pretoria, South Africa–each run by a Regional Deputy Chief of Party (DCOP).  However at the end of July 2012 the Pretoria office was closed and program implementation for Southern Africa was handled by the Nairobi office, becoming the Africa Lead East and Southern Africa (ESA) office. Program implementation and operations in the Nairobi and Accra offices are supported by a Bethesda-based office headed by the program’s Chief of Party (COP).
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Africa Lead was initially a two-year task order under the RAISE Plus Indefinite Quantity Contract (IQC) mechanism, designed to run from September 20, 2010 to September 30, 2012, with a budget ceiling of $21,332,381. As of a September 30, 2012 contract modification, the Program was extended for one year (through September 2013) and the ceiling was raised by $4,850,000 to $26,182,381. In addition, Africa Lead received a 3 month no cost extension in September 2013, putting the final end of contract as November 30, 2013.

                        <h4>Africa Lead has four main goals:</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>To provide training to strengthen capacity of African professional to assume leadership roles in their own institutions for moving the CAADP agenda forward</li>
                            <li>To assess human resource and institutional capacity to inform the types of training and investment that will impact the ability of key institutions to meet FTF larger goals</li>
                            <li>To develop a data base of African institutions who can provide training in priority areas</li>
                            <li>To provide organizational and logistical support to participant trainings in priority areas</li>
                        </ul>

                    </div>
                    <p>Africa Lead is a highly flexible mechanism that provided a variety of capacity building options to the USAID South, East and West Africa Regional Missions and to local Missions in all 12 African Feed the Future (FTF) focus and aligned countries. Africa Lead provides leadership training, capacity assessments, logistical support for training and innovative short courses and internships/twinning arrangements prioritized in consultation with missions and partner countries and institutions, and a database of training offerings on the continent that can be matched to the leadership training and capacity building needs.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     The flexibility of Africa Lead as a mechanism means that the same set of tools can be used for institutional capacity assessments and for capacity building needs in a wide range of different contexts and environments, and can be used at the continental, regional, national or sub-national levels. By providing these capacity building options it strived to increase the participation of African leaders and institutions engaged in the CAADP process (SO1) and to strengthen key leaders technical and managerial skills and knowledge of agriculture systems and food security (SO2).

                    <h2>Structure of Africa Lead</h2>
                    <p>
Africa Lead was initially implemented from the three regional offices located in East, West and South Africa. In July 2012, the third office in South Africa was closed and all the project activities were implemented out of the Accra, Ghana office and the Nairobi, Kenya office. To work to achieve the project goals, the Africa Lead project was split into four main tasks each focusing on different key components of the project: training, support, assessments and the database. Each Task area was led by the task leader who was then overseen by the Chief of Party. Africa Lead’s main goals are implemented through activities that fall into four Tasks:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Task 1: Transformational Leadership Training and CAADP Sensitization</li>
                        <li>Task 2: Technical and Third Party Training, Conferences and Other Innovative Learning Experiences</li>
                        <li>Task 3: Institutional Capacity Needs Assessments</li>
                        <li>Task 4: Database of Technical and Managerial Short Courses on Offer from Universities and Training Institutions</li>

                    </ul>

                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <h3>Task 1: Transformational Leadership Training and CAADP Sensitization</h3>
                    <h4>Overview and Methodology</h4>
                    <p>When the Africa Lead program began in 2010 the Bureau of Food Security asked Regional and local Missions and their African counterparts to identify mid-level professionals working in agriculture and food security to participate in a training program to develop leadership skills and knowledge relevant to moving the CAADP process forward at the national level. The objective in 2010 was to generate a pool of skilled food security Champions in each country who were informed about and committed to CAADP, and motivated to engage with their national governments around CAADP. The first wave of trainings, in a 5-day residential course called Module One, was held in Nairobi, Accra and Pretoria, where the Africa Lead regional offices were located. They drew participants from multiple countries and contained sessions focused on leadership skills for food security and CAADP. The exception was Uganda, where Module One trainings were held for Ugandans only.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Africa Lead’s Task One: provision of leadership and management training to African food security leaders through two capacity building courses designed and delivered. This included establishing a strong cadre of leaders to spearhead implementation of the CAADP framework and National Agriculture Investment Plans (NAIPs) at the national level, and to establish individual action plans which trainees will follow to advance inclusive, pro-poor agriculture growth and food security agendas in the context of their roles, networks and institutions at home. Africa Lead Task One training workshops integrate technical content on CAADP and integrated food security frameworks with content on leadership skills, change management and managing for results.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Under Task One Africa lead developed and delivered a variety of different training modules. Africa Lead started with the two main Modules that were focused on leadership and rapid results. Later in the project these training were adapted, adjusted and combined to cater to other audiences. This includes the training for the national non-state actors, a combined module was taught in Ghana and other trainings were tailored for the private sector. Overall the trainings broke down into three categories: 
                    </p>
                    <ul>

                        Each training played its role in contributing the overall project goal to strengthen the capacity of African professional. Although Module One and Two were the main focus of Africa Lead they were also adjusted and adapted the training to meet the needs of the different stakeholders to be able to reach a wider breach of audiences. This flexibility was shown throughout the implementation of Africa Lead and is one of the main qualities that made this program so successful. All of the modules incorporated approaches to nurture and set in place institutional and policy environments that promoted innovative responses.  They were designed to help foster leadership networks across the continent to help reinforce a new approach of development that is evidence based, strategic and results-focused.

                        Africa Lead has trained 1,875 (1,246—Male, and 629—Female) mid- and senior-level professionals in leadership skills and approaches and CAADP principles and processes (this number includes participants from Module 1, Module 2, and Module 1 &2 trainings). CAADP Champions for Change graduates are English or French speakers from 29 countries in sub-Saharan Africa who work across a broad range of sectors: 31% hail from NGOs and civil society institutions, 43% from the public sector, 13% from the private sector, and 13% from universities and research institutions.

                    <p>Module One was launched in January 2011. It is a five day course was designed to build the leadership and management gap in agriculture institutions and identify, prioritize and implement strong agriculture policies, investments and programs. The goals of the training were to increase knowledge of CAADP, participation in CAADP implementation and leadership and change management skills. Post-training surveys suggest participants acquired the skills and motivation during training to champion institutional changes that promote food security and CAADP.

                        In late 2010, a draft curriculum was completed Washington and a dozen potential trainers were brought together for a three day Training of Trainers (ToT) in Nairobi. From that group, eight were selected eight to deliver the Module One leadership and CAADP program sensitization training. The training comprised 40 hours of exercises on topics including Food Security, CAADP Principles, Leading and Managing Change, Strategic Thinking and Planning, Visioning, Stakeholder Analysis, Capacity Needs Assessments, Monitoring and Evaluation and Advocacy. However it was at this ToT that the curriculum became “Africanized” which became one the key elements of the training and contributed greatly to the success and acceptance of the training. Several of the key elements that became the most impactful to the participants were created at the ToT. These included the Little Girl, the Animal Game and Filling the African Pot

                        Task One’s highly participatory techniques incorporates current understanding of best practices for adult learning and their extensive depth of experience to share. They also have a variety of learning styles, including visual, auditory and kinesthetic. Each workshop session includes elements catering to each learning style with breakouts for small groups to interact, share and relate content to their own life experience. Great care was taken in both East and West Africa on selection of facilitators for the workshops. Only those sensitive and responsive to body language and affect of participants, who asked open-ended questions to bring out and engage participants, and who understood the material on a technical level were hired. Africa Lead staff training coordinators, who also attended trainings, provided ongoing feedback to the facilitators, so within a short time they were exceptionally skilled in establishing a warm safe environment and encouraging participation. Most Module One workshops were residential and participants were actively encouraged to engage with one another and to expand their professional networks.

                        Another key component to the role out of the Module One training in East Africa was the designing of all the material that has become synonymous with the “Champion brand”. These included, Champion canvas bags, Champion banners for photos, Awards and the training manual.

                        The Module One course was found to be “transformative” and much of this success goes to the Kenyan master trainers who were able to elicit strong emotions from the participants. The curriculum took large concepts such as poverty, gender inequality and hunger to a personal level and research has shown that this made an important impact. Each session brought together participants from different countries and sectors which gave them a platform to share experiences and develop personal and country action plans.

                        The purpose of Module One was to provide leadership training to actual and potential champions for African agriculture and food security growth and development, including CAADP Country and REC team members as well as key stakeholders, that would enable a more effective shared vision around investment programs, secure public and donor funding for priority programs and drive the “business unusual” that is at the core of CAADP.  Module 1 focused on the “soft” but undeniably critical skills associated with change management, leadership, developing, conveying and maintaining a shared vision, and building up a “critical mass” of champions who constitute a community of practice, and will advocate for the resources and political support to achieve key agriculture and food security goals.

                        Graduates of the trainings call themselves CAADP Champions for Change or simply Champions for Food Security – a branding that came out of Module One training. These terms were then used by the “Champions” themselves to identify and relate to others that had participated in the workshop. No matter where or when they took the training the “Champions” could relate to each other work together.

                    <p>
Module two which was initially designed to be more of a technical course on specific skill sets that had been identified both during Module One trainings and institutional capacity assessment in Task 3. Module Two was to be delivered to a sub set of Module 1 graduates, However it became apparent that this course would need to be tailored to fit the needs of each Mission and for this reason the designers in DC came up with a 4 day course outline which included the powerful Rapid Results Initiative and mixed and matched and added sessions for a 5 day course to suit specific needs and requirements for FTF partners. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In Module Two, the primary focus is on managing for results and a primary methodology is the Rapid Result’s Institute’s Rapid Results Approach (RRA). The RRA is a simple but highly choreographed process whereby organizations (or operational units within organizations) develop rapid results initiatives (RRI) focused on achieving an ambitious goal in 60 to 120 days. The structure of the initiative is carried out in three acts – pre-launch, launch and implementation. Each act is designed to neutralize common systemic barriers to performance. The provision of coaching support during the implementation phase is an important part of the RRA concept. The three unique elements of a rapid results initiative are depicted in the visual below:

                        Module Two is more focused on management skills needed to implement and accelerate initiatives to transform agriculture and achieve food security at sub-national, national or regional levels. Module One is more focused on nurturing leaders who are motivated and able to spearhead policy change processes and agriculture transformation in their countries. In addition, most Module Two trainings were held in the country of the local USAID Mission paying for the training and only include participants from a single country, single set of organizations or single institution, depending on the objective of the training. The exception to this is Module Two trainings paid for by the Regional Missions which target staff from regional institutions with roles in CAADP’s four pillars or those key to facilitating regional economic integration.

Match private sector hosts from more technically advanced economies with participants from enterprises needing technical skills upgrades to achieve their potential and, in some cases, more effectively supply firms that are further down the supply chain. Africa Lead ESA has been instrumental in the implementation of the Agribusiness Internship program that is designed to match private sector hosts from more technically advanced economies with participants from enterprises that need technical skills upgrades to achieve their potential and, in some cases, to more effectively supply firms that are further up or down the supply chain.  </p>

                        Africa lead create relationships with different businesses approaching them to 
Johannesburg Stock Exchange Limited: The internship program with Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) was housed in the Commodity Derivatives Division.. It was the first of the senior internship programs in which there were multiple interns who essentially experienced the same learning experience. Four agribusiness professionals from East and Southern Africa participated. In the three week experience each intern had, each was exposed to all aspects of grain trading on a commodities futures market, from storage to trading and currency issues. As stated in Mr. Masila’s report, the objectives of the internship were primarily to understand the concepts of commodity exchanges, spot versus futures markets, futures derivatives versus options, to experience a live trading and operations environment, gain insights on setting up an exchange, and to meet, interact with and establish contacts with JSE. East African grain traders are keen to establish more robust and connected grain trading, including futures markets, and this sort of contact with a private-sector based and well established market is beneficial.

                    <p>Hershey Co., USA: When Tizita Alemu, Inspections Manager at ECX spent two months as a Global Procurement Associate in the Cocoa Risk Management Group of Hershey Co., U.S.A., she learned firsthand about how global private sector food companies rely on market intelligence and standardized practices to secure procurement investments and to hedge their risks against future price increases. The training Ms. Alemu received in Hershey’s commodity operations is manifesting itself in efficiencies and risk management as more staff and warehouse operators are trained in best practices.  The transfer of ownership from warehouse receipts and an unprecedented one-day clearing and settlement payment system that ECX offers enhances reliability to both buyers and sellers.</p>

                        NARS Internship Program: Since February 2013, Africa Lead commenced an internship program for research institutions in Chad, Nigeria, Cameroon and Liberia. Other beneficiary countries included Congo, Ghana, Gabon, Mauritania and CAR. Beneficiaries participated in a 4 week internship program with CORAF in Senegal to obtain hands on experiences in research. The program ended in July, 2013. Africa Lead provided logistical support for all the internship program beneficiaries.

                        Sokoine University of Agriculture (SUA) in Tanzania and Africa Lead are embarked on a proactive partnership to support graduates of the University’s Department of Agricultural Economics and Agribusiness in applying their studies to agricultural business development. Profit-oriented business development is still new in Tanzania. To date 24 of these entrepreneurially-minded agriculturalists have been embedded in private companies working in agricultural-based industries along different product value chains. The 8-week placements are designed to immerse these young professionals in a hands-on business environment to guide the development of start-up agribusiness enterprises.  Many of the host business are owned or managed by Africa Lead-trained Champions for Change for Food Security.

                        We have negotiated participation of many of the host companies and nominated most of the successful candidates. There were several interesting internship opportunities for participants nominated from the ESA region. The primary focus is on the FTF commodity value chains, especially cereals.  Host companies and ESA nominated candidates were sought for structured commodity/ grain trade positions, grain storage and milling, among others.

                    <h4>Non-State Actor’s Training:</h4>
                    <p>
                        Although Module 1& 2 started out to be Africa Lead’s main training focus, it soon became clear that there was a need for these to be adapted to fit the different agendas of other stakeholders. As part of the USAID support to the CAADP process, in 2011 Africa Lead developed a simplified three-day training directed towards assisting civil society and the private sector to learn how to effectively dialogue with Government in order to participate fully in the CAADP process and have their voices heard. Africa Lead conducted a series of country non-state actor (NSA) (community-based, academic, media, private sector organizations) workshops aimed at increasing and improving the quality of involvement of non-state actors in the CAADP National Agriculture Investment Plan implementation process. 
In most of the countries that have signed the Comprehensive Africa Agricultural Development Programme (CAADP) compacts, key Non State Actors (NSAs1) did not fully participate in the process of the development of the National Agricultural Development Plans (NAIPs) that included setting of priorities for agricultural investments. CAADP recognizes that to transform African agriculture it is imperative to build broad and inclusive coalitions. More inclusion of non-state actors, especially poor and marginalized communities required at all levels. The platform asked how to improve the quality of inclusion and in response CAADP partners have formed a CAADP NSA Coordinating Task Team. The Task Team was launched in November 2010 in Johannesburg by the NEPAD Planning and Coordinating Agency (NPCA) to help bridge the gap in CAADP consultation and implementation processes at country level. Identified Roles of NSA are summarized as: 
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>i. Planning </li>
                        <li>ii. Implementation </li>
                        <li>iii. Reform and enabling environment </li>
                        <li>iv. Accountability </li>

                    </ul>
                    <h4>Other Customized Trainings:</h4>
                    <p>
                        The East and West African Regional and local Missions submitted buy-in orders for Africa Lead training workshops based on customized blends of the original Module One curriculum and the Module Two curriculum. Examples of customized trainings include adaptations of the Module One leadership training for high level Parliamentarians in Uganda and Government-to-Government Policy Dialogues developed to facilitate collaboration and coordination on policy formation and planning among ministries in Tanzania. The adaptability of Africa Lead’s training curricula to cater to different audiences or training objectives depending on the strategic interests of the Mission buying in constitutes an important level of flexibility that allows Africa Lead to address widely different contexts at sub-national, national and regional levels with a relatively simple set of capacity building tools.

                    <p>The purpose of task 3 of the Africa Lead project was to identify key areas that areas in African institutions that need strengthening including in their design, funding, review, implementation and monitoring and evaluation of food security development plans.  Once identified, the purpose is to seek to match short course offerings, primarily from African institutions, that can strengthen these institutions.  Under this task assessments were designed and carried out to assess the capacity needs of national and regional institutions, CAADP Country Teams, and National Agriculture Investment Plan implementation.</p>

This work involved developing a case study research methodology, writing the assignment’s Scope of Work, finding and hiring in-country consultants, conducting field work, and producing draft reports. Draft reports were produced and underwent a field review process that involved USAID Missions and a representative of the African Union Commission. Reports were finalized during this quarter and an initial draft of an overall lessons learned synthesis report was sent to USAID for review.

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>This project seeks to enhance and grow a database of short courses and Open Educational Resources (OER) offered by different institutions, which can be used to facilitate the ongoing development of agricultural professionals, students and other stakeholders working in the agricultural sector. The database of short courses of the &nbsp;Africa Lead Project was initially designed and implemented by Michigan State University.&nbsp; It was taken over by OER Africa which is at present hosting the database on a stand-alone server, for an African-wide programme. OER Africa, together with RUFORUM is responsible for overseeing the updating of the database on a regular basis.</p>

<p>The database is being publicized widely not only to graduates of the Africa Lead Champions for Change courses but to many other high ranking personnel in government positions, faculty, non-governmental organizations and other interested persons. The Champions for Change programme seeks to build the capacity of agriculture leaders to prioritize activities and implement Regional and Country Agriculture Investment Plans within the CAADP framework. The database serves as a valuable resource that will ensure that some of the courses offered by Africa&rsquo;s finest agricultural institutions and many in America, Europe and worldwide will be rendered highly visible, to ensure their widespread dissemination and usage.</p>

<p>Beginning December 2012, OER Africa in conjunction with RUFORUM, the Regional Universities Forum for Capacity Building in Agriculture, trained staff and students at 19 universities across Eastern and Southern Africa (in Ethiopia, Kenya, Lesotho, Uganda, Tanzania, Malawi, Zambia, Zimbabwe and Swaziland) in the use of the Africa Lead Database. &nbsp;INSERT OER&rsquo;S &ldquo;tuorial&rdquo; interactive HTML file.&nbsp; This phase of the project aimed to introduce institutions to the database and to teach individuals there how to upload information about their course offerings and therefore increase their dissemination. A total of 25 institutions (in Kenya, Malawi, Tanzania, Uganda, Ethiopia, Lesotho, Swaziland, Mozambique , Rwanda and South Africa) were invited to participate. Only the South African institutions targeted by the project were not members of RUFORUM.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The training component of the project was implemented over 3 months (December 2013 to February 2013) with very tight timeframes that resulted in a series of challenges that speak to some of the overall lessons learnt. These are discussed later on in this brief report. However, despite the challenges faced this aspect of the project was successfully completed and the database base continues to grow steadily. With regards to implementation at the institutions, challenges mostly had to do with access to the internet and the use of old and incompatible software and hardware, but in general the project was well received. The targeting of the right institutional staff members was found to be critical in ensuring buy-in and participation.</p>

<h1>The graphic (a screen grab from the database) below gives an indication of some of the overall database statistics for the period 1 December 2012 to 30 September 2013.</h1>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><img src="file:///C:/Users/nhilbert/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image002.jpg" style="height:284px" /></p>

<p>It can be seen that over 3500 people have visited the database during the period 1 December 2012 to 30 September 2013 with 80.67% of the visits being first time ones and a return rate of 19.2%. The average visit duration was 3 minutes and 23 seconds. There is a bounce-rate of 60.88% which is rather high and needs further interrogation. The accessing of the database has been more or less consistent as shown by the graph above, however the number of courses newly uploaded at different times varied considerably with 444 being uploaded during the period December 2012 to February 2013, and then 93 and 131 new uploads over the next two time periods (March to June and then July to September 2013).&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The initial big difference in the new course uploads is probably due to the fact that the project team was actively involved in ensuring project milestones were achieved during the first time period. It was also the beginning of the academic year at many institutions and so they had their course offerings ready. Most visits to the site were from South Africa which may be linked to the fact that the top course providers are also from South Africa and Namibia.</p>

<p>Of the top 20 providers eight are higher education institutions whilst the rest consist of other training organizations involved in development. The top 20 course providers can be seen from the database screen grab in table 1 below. The majority of these providers serve institutions and individuals situated on the African continent however there were some from other countries such as the United States of America, United Kingdom and Malaysia. The number of course providers has increased steadily from 151 to 192 over the ten month period from December 2012 to September 2013.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>TABLE2</p>

<h3>Lessons learnt</h3>

<p>Despite the challenges faced much was achieved within very tight and inflexible time-frames. However there are a few lessons learnt from the project that should be taken into consideration for the planning and implementation of future projects of this nature:</p>

<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not all African higher education institution staff had regular access to internet or laptops or up-to-date software and so alternative ways had to be used in training them to learn about and use the database. In this regard, a simulation (online and offline) was developed and used to show people how to use the database by projecting pictures via a data projector. CDs and a training pamphlet were disseminated to all participants to support them in accessing and using the database after the initial training.</p>

<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A template to collect course information was also developed that could be filled in easily on one&rsquo;s computer using a word processing package or could printed out for a person to complete manually, scan and submit. This sort of tool proved to very useful when training at sites where connectivity and access to suitable hardware and software was limited.</p>

<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is important to <em>target the right people for the training</em> especially those tasked by their institutions to make their courses/programmes visible &ndash; in this way one contributes to ensuring the continuity, sustainability and growth of the database. At some institutions trainers felt that some of the beneficiaries sent for the training were not the right ones meaning that in the long run the institution would not benefit from the capacity being developed.</p>

<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There were some challenges experienced in <em>identifying and getting permission for the right people to be trained</em> &ndash; in some instances the associated bureaucratic red-tape and hierarchical institutional protocol created bottlenecks, barriers and delays. These issues need to be taken into consideration up-front and also link directly to lesson 3 listed above</p>

<ol>
    <li>Institutions have times of the year when it is <em>difficult to involve staff (especially academic staff) in training because of heavy work commitments</em> as well as the inclusion of extended holidays &ndash; project implementation happened during such a period and academic staff (whilst interested) were not as keen to take the time off to engage properly with the training and advocacy interventions. This needs to be taken into consideration when looking at future project implementation -- be it training, or general on-site advocacy.</li>
    <li>Some <em>institutions were neither easily contactable nor accessible due to their geographical location</em>. Some thought has to be put into how best to reach and inform such institutions and get them to use and contribute to growing the database.</li>
    <li>There is a <em>need for more flexibility or else lengthened project timeframes</em> to accommodate the inflexibility of the USAID travel regulations and the slow response times to travel permission requests &ndash; much as it is understood why they are necessary, one cannot then generally expect good project outcomes when working with higher education institutions that have their own particular time related challenges (as outlined in lessons 4 and 5 above; we were lucky that the partners had project members based in 3 different countries that somehow mitigated this challenge and introduced a slight element of flexibility.</li>
    <li>Working with <em>RUFORUM as a partner was extremely beneficial and facilitated easier identification of and access to the participating institutions</em> and thus a better response was obtained from the RUFORUM member institutions as opposed to those that are not. Discussions held with the RUFORUM staff member that participated in institutional visits and training gave the following answers in response to the questions on the perceived <em>usefulness and sustainability of the database</em>:</li>
</ol>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Question: In your opinion is the database useful?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Response:</strong><em> &nbsp;&nbsp; Yes. It is useful to RUFORUM and the network as a whole. It closely links to our Theory of Change by addressing one of our deliverables &ldquo;Dynamic Platform for University Networking, Advocacy for Agricultural Higher Education&rdquo;</em></p>

<p><strong>Question: What is the relevance of promoting professional development through short courses among your member universities? </strong></p>

<p><strong>Response:</strong><em> &nbsp;&nbsp; The approach gives publicity to the ongoing short professional courses offered. The universities I visited had ongoing short courses that would be relevant for sharing within the network but had no central place to host or advertise the courses, nor was there someone to push this content/information online. </em></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Secondly, RUFORUM is keen to see its member universities academic rankings increase. This can be partly achieved through the visibility of their course offerings online which then contributes to the improved the visibility of the network universities. </em></p>

<p><em>Thirdly, the RUFORUM secretariat holds short skills enhancement courses or retreats for its postgraduate students. The Africa Lead Database could be used to enhance how RUFORUM delivers these courses. RUFORUM would then focus on packaging them so they are accessible and visible online. &nbsp;</em></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Question: <em>Where do you think the database should best be positioned or situated? </em></strong></p>

<p><strong>Response: &nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><em>I think given that the database serves to promote the universities content/course offerings and improve service delivery it would be best hosted by RUFORUM. We at RUFORUM see ourselves as having a platform that fosters collaboration between its member institutions. This also speaks well to our need to fulfill the dissemination aspect to the network of institutions.</em></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Question: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How will what you have learned whilst implementing the project guide your work aimed at sustaining the database?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Response:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><em>Clearly, the database needs to be hosted and someone dedicated to improving its content on an ongoing basis to make sure the information about courses offered within the network is available online. This will require time and resources. Some course offerings only become available through physical visits to institutions and getting to understand whom to work with to get the relevant information online.</em></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Question:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How did the grant provide catalytic help?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Response:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><em> It enabled capacity building through enabling the online training sessions and the physical visits. The skills attained were helpful and I am sure the website statistics also speak to this.</em></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>OER Africa team members are in agreement with these sentiments. The following section looks at some recommendations regarding the ways in which the database might be made sustainable.</p>

<h3>Sustainability of the database &ndash; some recommendations</h3>

<p>There is a need to find a sustainable way of growing the database further (in a resource friendly way) through new course uploads and increasing the number of visits to it. This requires a multi-pronged approach.</p>

<ol>
    <li>Encouraging continued institutional course uploads by:</li>
</ol>

<ul>
    <li>sending regular reminders to individuals who underwent training and where possible</li>
    <li>strategically targeting other individuals such as librarians, university marketing and short learning programme staff by email and phone to help get the message out there and collect the information required.</li>
</ul>

<p>This approach is likely to be more effective than trying to get academic staff members who are often extremely busy, to upload information on a regular basis.</p>

<ol>
    <li>Identifying and then directly marketing the database to short course service providers inviting them to either upload course information or provide hyperlinks to the relevant information. &nbsp;</li>
    <li>Advertising information about the database:
    <ul>
        <li>In the quarterly <em>Saide</em> online newsletter.</li>
        <li>other suitable online spaces such as OER Africa&rsquo;s AgShare and the RUFORUM websites as well as on</li>
        <li>institutional intranets (where possible).</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>&nbsp;Strategically piggy-backing some of the future Africa Lead training and advocacy at institutions to other project visits by the partners - to leverage existing resource synergies. Such an approach could contribute to more resource friendly continuous dissemination and advocacy about the database.</li>
    <li>Employing someone to spend a bit of time each month to:</li>
</ol>

<ul>
    <li><em>Search for and upload new courses</em> of existing service providers on the database</li>
    <li><em>Finding new service providers</em> (institutions and others) over and above the targeted ones &ndash; getting permission to upload their courses.&nbsp; A suitable template for capturing course information has been designed for this purpose. It can be sent out to the identified service providers who are then invited to provide course details that are then uploaded.</li>
    <li><em>maintain the functionality of the database and its server</em></li>
    <li>regularly <em>keep track of course uploads and database hits</em></li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This could possibly require additional financial resources however these costs could be paid for through cross-subsidization from related projects or aligning and embedding the database in either the OER Africa or RUFORUM spaces. However in order for this to be done in a sustainable way:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
    <li>The database could be converted to a more suitable platform that would make for easier administration and management. For example: right now it is a stand-alone database - on the Wordpress platform, and has limited tools. This platform differs from that of both OER Africa (Drupal) and the RUFORUM repository (AgriDrupal) &ndash; these platforms have tools that would improve the usability and visibility of the database.</li>
    <li>&nbsp;If the database were moved to the RUFORUM or OER Africa web-spaces it would mean all the available Agriculture open education resources and the short course information could be and accessed in one place.&nbsp;This would probably contribute to:<em> increased website functionality</em>, and <em>overall improved sustainability</em> as these two web spaces are visited regularly by various individuals. Linking it directly to the RUFORUM platform would be particularly strategic as RUFORUMs target beneficiaries are the same ones we would wish to use the database.</li>
    <li>It has been estimated that such a conversion would take about 15 days.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This would also be a cost-effective approach as the tools required are already in the system and would improve database functionality. This would mean the database is no longer a stand-alone, which is a challenge at present because it means maintaining a separate platform that needs an extra set of resources.</li>
    <li>At present there is also a high bounce rate and the database is not found that easily &ndash; this is attributed to the way the landing page is designed. There is a need to <em>improve the look and feel of the landing page</em> to mitigate the bounce rate.</li>
</ul>

<ol>
    <li><em>Follow up contact and the provision of online and telephonic support of the staff at institutions</em> where training has taken place to encourage them to keep up with ongoing course uploads (as the courses become available) or to submit the information so that they can be uploaded for them</li>
    <li>A <em>workshop training template</em> can be developed to support on-site training. This together with the <em>training simulation</em> designed to support staff involved in carrying out the database training can be circulated to those newly trained or introduced to the database, so that they can <em>continue training and provide support</em> at their institutions. These tools might need some revision if the database is shifted onto another platform.</li>
</ol>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>The database is useful and can definitely contribute to ongoing professional development and capacity building. However, in order to encourage its continued growth there is a need to mitigate those factors that have been identified as impacting negatively on the database and its use. The lessons learnt and the recommendations made in this report can be used to further improve the database and contribute to its sustainability in the longer term.</p>
